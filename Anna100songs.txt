song: Skinny Love
band: Bon Iver
emotions: sad, love


Come on skinny love just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer


Tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in this moment this order's tall


And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind


In the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines


Come on skinny love, what happened here?
We suckled on the hope in lite brassieres
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split


And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind


And now all your love is wasted
And then who the hell was I?
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines


Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?
Ooh, ooh


song: Holocene
band: Bon Iver
emotions: sad, wistful


"Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me."
You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it friend,
It's on it's head,
It struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet


... and at once I knew I was not magnificent
Strayed above the highway aisle
(Jagged vacance, thick with ice)
I could see for miles, miles, miles


3rd and Lake it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me 'Lip Parade'
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me


... and at once I knew I was not magnificent
Hulled far from the highway aisle
(Jagged, vacance, thick with ice)
I could see for miles, miles, miles


Christmas night,
It clutched the light,
The hallow bright
Above my brother,
I and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make
It what it was to be
Now to know it in my memory:


... and at once I knew I was not magnificent
High above the highway aisle
(Jagged vacance, thick with ice)
I could see for miles, miles, miles


song: Towers
band: Bon Iver
emotions: sad, love


For the love, I'd fallen on
In the swampy August dawn
What a mischief you would bring, young darling
When the onus is not all your own
When you're up for it before you've grown
From the faun forever gone
In the towers of your honeycomb
I'd a tore your hair out just to climb back, darling
When you're filling out your only form
Can you tell that it's just ceremon'?
Now you've added up to what you're from
Build your tether rain-out from your fragments [unverified]
Break the sailor's table on your sacrum [unverified]
Fuck the fiercest fables, I'm with Hagen
For the love, comes the burning young
From the liver, sweating through your tongue
Well, you're standing on my sternum don't you climb down, darling
Oh, the sermons are the first to rest
Smoke on Sundays when you're drunk and dressed
Out the hollows where the swallow nests


song: Michicant
band: Bon Iver
emotions: sad, love


I was unafraid, I was a boy
I was a tender age
Melic in the naked, knew a lake
And drew the lofts for page
Hurdle, all the waiting's up
Know it wasn't wedded love
4 long minutes end and it was over
It'd all be back
And the frost took up the eyes
Pressed against the pane, could see the veins
And there was poison out
Resting in a raze, the inner claims
I hadn't breath to shake
Searching for an inner clout
May not take another bout
Honey in the hale could fill the pales
Of loving less with vain
Hon, it wasn't yet the spring
Aiming and it sunk and we were drunk
And we had fleshed it out
Nose up in the globes, you never know
If you are passing out
No, it wasn't maiden-up
The falling or the faded luck
Hung up in the ivory, both were
Climbing for a finer cause
Love can hardly leave the room
With your heart


song: No Ones Gonna Love You
band: Band of Horses
emotions: sad, love


It's looking like a limb torn off
Or altogether just taken apart
We're reeling through an endless fall
We are the ever-living ghost of what once was


But no one is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do


And anything to make you smile
It is my better side of you to admire
But they should never take so long
Just to be over then back to another one


But no one is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do


But someone,
They could have warned you
When things start splitting at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumbling down
Things start splitting at the seams and now
If things start splitting at the seams and now,
It's tumbling down
Hard.


Anything to make you smile
You are the ever-living ghost of what once was
I never want to hear you say
That you'd be better off
Or you liked it that way


But no one is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do


But someone
They should have warned you
When things start splitting at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumbling down
Things start splitting at the seams and now
If things start splitting at the seams and now,
It's tumbling down
Hard


song: On My Way Back Home
band: Band of Horses
emotions: soft, sad, wistful


On my way back home, by chance I thought of
All my favorite songs, where I'd gone wrong
The only words that I could think of
I'm pissing my life away in the form of a song
On my way back home


Every step, a victory it was
I was cheating death, just in time I woke
My memories start to wander off
Come to me, the remembrance of
On my way back home


I came in this way and here now I'll stay
If the unknown have to wait one more day
There's often times that it comes out wrong
But luckily I, I got a mind to know
On my way back home


song: New Slang
band: The Shins
emotions: wistful, soft


Gold teeth and a curse for this town were all in my mouth. 
Only, i don't know how they got out, dear. 
Turn me back into the pet that i was when we met. 
I was happier then with no mind-set. 


And if you'd 'a took to me like 
A gull takes to the wind. 
Well, I'd 'a jumped from my tree 
And I'd a danced like the king of the eyesores 
And the rest of our lives would 'a fared well. 


New slang when you notice the stripes, the dirt in your fries. 
Hope it's right when you die, old and bony. 
Dawn breaks like a bull through the hall, 
Never should have called 
But my head's to the wall and I'm lonely. 


And if you'd 'a took to me like 
A gull takes to the wind. 
Well, I'd 'a jumped from my tree 
And I'd a danced like the kind of the eyesores 
And the rest of our lives would 'a fared well. 


God speed all the bakers at dawn may they all cut their thumbs, 
And bleed into their buns 'till they melt away. 


I'm looking in on the good life i might be doomed never to find. 
Without a trust or flaming fields am i too dumb to refine? 
And if you'd 'a took to me like 
Well I'd a danced like the queen of the eyesores 
And the rest of our lives would 'a fared well.


song: A Comet Appears
band: The Shins
emotions: sad, soft


One hand on this wily comet,
Take a drink just to give me some weight,
Some uber-man I'd make,
I'm barely a vapor


They shone a chlorine light on,
A host of individual sins,
Let's carve my aging face off,
Fetch us a knife,
Start with my eyes,
Down so the lines,
Form a grimacing smile,


Close your eyes to corral a virtue,
Is this fooling anyone else?
Never worked so long and hard,
To cement a failure,


We can blow on our thumbs and posture,
But the lonely is such delicate things,
The wind from a wasp could blow them,
Into the sea,
With stones on their feet,
Lost to the light and the loving we need,


emotions: wistful, soft
Still to come,
The worst part and you know it,
There is a numbness,
In your heart and it's growing,


With burnt sage and a forest of bygones,
I click my heels,
Get the devils in line,
A list of things I could lay the blame on,
Might give me a way out,


But with each turn,
It's this front and center,
Like a dart stuck square in your eye,
Every post you can hitch your faith on,
Is a pie in the sky,
Chock full of lies,
A tool we devise,
To make sinking stones fly,


emotions: wistful, soft
And still to come,
The worst part and you know it,
There is a numbness,
In your heart and it's growing.


song: I Will Follow You Into the Dark
band: Death Cab for Cutie
emotions: romantic, sad


Love of mine, some day you will die
But I'll be close behind
I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight
Waiting for the hint of a spark


If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"'s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark


In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me,
"Son, fear is the heart of love."
So I never went back


If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"'s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark


You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary
And the soles of your shoes are all worn down
The time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about
'Cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms


If Heaven and Hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"'s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
Then I'll follow you into the dark


song: First Day of My Life
band: Bright Eyes
emotions: romantic, wistful, soft


This is the first day of my life
I swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach


Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
Now I don’t know where I am 
I don’t know where I’ve been
But I know where I want to go


And so I thought I’d let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you 
And I wondered if I could come home


Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up 
And you said “this is the first day of my life
I’m glad I didn’t die before I met you 
But now I don’t care I could go anywhere with you
And I’d probably be happy”


So if you want to be with me
With these things there’s no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I’d rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery
Besides maybe this time is different
I mean I really think you like me


song: Christmas TV
band: Slow Club
emotions: soft, romantic, wistful


It's okay to have scars
They will make you who you are
It's okay to have fear
Because that means you aren't scared of coming here
And in the middle of the night
just call if you wanna talk
Cause you know that I'll wanna talk too
It's not bad of you to think of what might go wrong
But you can't blame me for secretly hoping that I will prove you wrong
It's okay that I pray that you will miss your flight
And have to stay with me another night


It's brutal it's brutal 
Why cant you see
It's brutal it's brutal
Where have you been
Because we are far apart
And my lonely heart
Finds it hard to get through the night
You pulled me out of the dark and now it's light
You pulled me out of the dark and now it's light


When we are out in the market
And out on the streets
I've got a pocket full of problems
And a pocket full of seeds 
Hoping something good might grow out of this mistletoe
And I won't have to erase your memory


I like the way that our arguments stop when we fall asleep
And the way that body feels when it's wrapped around me
And I'd like it if you made it to mine my Christmas Eve
So you can hold me
And we'll watch Christmas TV


It is brutal it's brutal 
Why cant you see
It's brutal it's brutal
Where have you been
Because we are far apart
And my lonely heart
Finds it hard to get through the night
You pulled me out of the dark and now it's light
You pulled me out of the dark and now it's light


So come on home 
Just come on home


song: One October Song
singer: Nico Stai
emotions: sad, soft


You know that thing 
That you say you sometimes dream of 
Well I think it's happening to me 
You know they say 
That time will take a hold of you 
Well 
You kill the voice or it kills you 


Oh no 
You shouldn't really speak about it 
Oh no 
You shouldnt really speak about it 


And you look thin 
Well the drugs will make you thinner still 
The sort of thing you'd never see 
Look up and up and up and up above and up above now 
And count your lucky stars 


But oh no 
You shouldnt really speak about it 
You shouldnt really speak about it 


You know that thing 
That you say you sometimes dream of 
Well I think it's happening to me


song: Kettering
band: The Antlers
emotions: sad, soft, romantic


I wish that I had known in
That first minute we met
The unpayable debt
That I owed you


'Cause you'd been abused
By the bone that refused 
You and you hired me
To make up for that


And walking in that room
When you had tubes in your arms
Those singing morphine alarms
Out of tune


They had you sleeping and eating and
And I didn't believe them
When they called you a hurricane thunderclap


When I was checking vitals
I suggested a smile
You didn't talk for a while
You were freezing


You said you hated my tone
It made you feel so alone
So you told me I had to be leaving


But something kept me standing
By that hospital bed
I should have quit but instead
I took care of you


You made me sleep and uneven
And I didn't believe them
When they told me that there
Was no saving you


song: The A Team
singer: Ed Sheeran
emotions: sad, soft, wistful


White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in her pipe she'll fly to the Motherland
And sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped glove, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank note
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Cool girl, no phone
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she'll fly to the Motherland
And sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes
And hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we'll fly to the Motherland
And sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
To fly, fly
For angels to fly, to fly, to fly
or angels die


song: Give Me Love
singer: Ed Sheeran
emotions: romantic, soft


Give me love like her,
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone.
Paint splatted tear drops on my shirt,
Told you I'd let them go.
And that I'll find my corner,
Maybe tonight I'll call ya,
After my blood turns into alcohol,
No I just wanna hold ya,
Give a little time to me, or burn this out,
We'll play hide and seek, to turn this around,
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,
My my, my my-y oh give me love,
My my, my my-y oh give me love,
My my, my my-y oh give me love,
My my, my my-y oh give me love,
My my, my my-y oh give me love
Give me love like never before,
'Cause lately I've been craving more.
And it's been a while but i still feel the same,
Maybe I should let you go
You know I'll find my corner,
And that tonight I'll call ya,
After my blood, is drowning in alcohol,
No I just wanna hold ya,
Give a little time to me, or burn this out,
We'll play hide and seek, to turn this around,
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,
My my, my my-y, oh give me love
Give a little time to me, or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek, to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow.
my my, my my-y, oh give me love
my my, my my-y oh give me love,

song: In My Sleep
singer: Austin Hartley-Leonard
emotions: romantic, sad


Someday, dark has turned to grey
The stars have made their way
I raise my glass and part my lips tend to many deep
The only time I see you is in my sleep
 
Someday, get up on my way
I think I'll be okay for a while
I know you were never mine to keep
But I know that I'll see you in my sleep
 
But time has been unkind
and kept me far from you
But I know you will be holding me
In my sleep
 
I've been hanging on
scraping by all my life
And I know you will be holding me
In my sleep
 
I've been hanging on
Scraping by all my life
 
And I know I'll miss you
I'll always miss you
But I know I'll see you
In my sleep
 
I know I'll miss you
I'll always miss you
But I know I'll see you
In my sleep


song: Id Rather Be With You
singer: Joshua Radin
emotions: romantic, soft, happy


Sitting here, on this lonely dock
Watch the rain play on the ocean top
All the things I feel I need to say
I can't explain in any other way
I need to be bold
Need to jump in the cold water
Need to grow older with a girl like you
Finally see you are naturally
The one to make it so easy
When you show me the truth
Yeah, I'd rather be with you
Say you want the same thing too
Now here's the sun, come to dry the rain
Warm my shoulders and relieve my pain
You're the one thing that I'm missing here
With you beside me I no longer fear
I need to be bold
Need to jump in the cold water
Need to grow older with a girl like you
Finally see you are naturally
The one to make it so easy
When you show me the truth
Yeah, I'd rather be with you
Say you want the same thing too
I could have saved so much time for us
Had I seen the way to get to where I am today
You waited on me for so long
So now, listen to me say:
I need to be bold
Need to jump in the cold water
Need to grow older with a girl like you
Finally see you are naturally
The one to make it so easy
When you show me the truth
Yeah, I'd rather be with you
Say you want the same thing too
Say you feel the way I do


song: Winter
singer: Joshua Radin
emotions: sad, soft, romantic


I should know
Who I am by now
I walk
The record stands somehow
Thinking of winter


Your name is the splinter inside me
While I wait


And I remember the sound
Of your November downtown
And I remember the truth
A warm December with you
But I don't have to make this mistake
And I don't have to stay this way
If only I would wait


The walk has all been cleared by now
Your voice is all I hear somehow
Calling out Winter


Your voice is the splinter inside me
While I wait


I remember the sound
Of your November downtown
And I remember the truth
A warm December with you
But I don't have to make this mistake
And I don't have to stay this way
If only I would wait


I could have lost myself
In rough blue waters in your eyes
And I miss you still


I remember the sound
Of your November downtown
And I remember the truth
A warm December with you
But I don't have to make this mistake
And I don't have to stay this way
If only I would wait


song: Only You
singer: Joshua Radin
emotions: romantic, wistful, soft


Looking from the window above 
It's like a story of love 
Can you hear me? 
Came back only yesterday 
Who went further away 
Want you near me 


All I needed was the love you gave 
All I needed for another day 
And all I ever knew 
Only you 


Sometimes when I think of her name 
When it's only a game 
And I need you 
Listen to the words that you say 
It's getting harder to stay 
When I need you 


All I needed was the love you gave 
All I needed for another day 
And all I ever knew 
Only you 


This is gonna take a long time 
And I wonder what's mine 
Can't take no more 


Wonder if you'll understand 
It's just the touch of your hand 
Behind a closed door 


All I needed was the love you gave 
All I needed for another day 
And all I ever knew 
Only you


song: Challengers
band: The New Pornographers
emotions: soft, wistful


Yes I know it was late 
We were greeting the sun 
Before long 
And you live with someone 

I live with somebody too 
Leave it there 
For safe keeping 
One of the west village in plains 
That was the custom 
Come dawn 


On the walls of the day 
In the shade of the sun 
We wrote down 
Another vision of us 
We were the challengers of 
The unknown 
"Be safe" you say 
Whatever the mess you are you mind okay 
That is the custom 
On down 


Na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na 
Na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na... 


Until I see you around 
Until we clear the accounts 
Leave it there 
Leave it to us 
We are the challengers of 
The unknown 


Oh-la, oh-la, oh-la, oh-la 
Oh-la, oh-la, oh-la, oh-la


song: Rejected Love
singer: Lars Eriksson
emotions: wistful, soft, sad


I was sitting by myself alone and you know
That in my room I don't have a phone
There was a knock on my door, but I'm not sure.


It was her, the girl who treasures me.
She said: I love you, do you love me?
I can't recall if I answered at all


She sat down on my bed treacherous ground
Her face turned red and didn't make a sound
She looked at me like a dog that wanted food


I thought to myself “I don't have a bone”
“But neither of us should have to feel so alone”
I was careful not to say anything rude


I didn't know if to kiss her
Or if I preferred to miss her
"This is just like some movie from before", she said


And she was on a love's train
But I was in an aeroplane
All we could do was to wave to one another


Silence is a voice of an equal choice
Girls sometimes wish that they were boys
And men they blush when the blood rushes too late


Echo is the voice of bouncing back
A gecko is a lizard and a rat is a rat
A no is a no is a no, I don't like that


Wanting is a need which wants to defeat
Rejecting which is greed of another need
She looked at me with original sinful eyes


And though the love of spring was in the air
My heart for her refused to care
A lock was there and she couldn't lock it up


And though for some that night was blessed
The knife of love cut through her chest
For her it was another failure stored in her soul


And love is blind and sometimes a fool
It can be oh, so kind, and just as cruel
All I could do was to try to play my role


Save my soul, save my soul
Save my soul, save my soul
You gotta save my soul


Come on and save my soul
Save my soul, save my soul
I got to save my soul


song: Maybe Maybe
singer: Nico Stai
emotions: soft, sad, wistful, romantic


cutting belts and magazines
and things you'll never need
the mirrors in your room at night
and skies that never fold
you're sorry that it matters more
but who would ever tell
I know you need to stay above
but I swore
I swore
I swore
it's all over your eyes
there's nothing you can do
I'm coming out my skin tonight
so tell me if you're ready or no
I'm tired of living out a lie
sitting here watching things flying by me
and maybe maybe
you're gonna save me
maybe maybe
but I don't know
I don't think so
last night I woke up cold
and I walked right out into the dark
and 800 reasons why kept flying into my eyes
wish I could say that i killed 'em dead
but they're just much bigger than I
it's all over your eyes
there's nothing you can do
I'm coming out my skin tonight
so tell me if you're ready or no
I'm tired of living out a lie
sitting here watching things flying by me
and maybe maybe
you're gonna save me
maybe maybe
but I don't know
I don't think so


song: To Build A Home
band: The Cinematic Orchestra
emotions: sad, soft, romantic


There is a house built out of stone
Wooden floors, walls and window sills
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
This is a place where I don't feel alone
This is a place where I feel at home.


And I built a home
for you
for me


Until it disappeared
from me
from you


And now, it's time to leave and turn to dust........


Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
There is a tree as old as me
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Ground had arose and passed its knees


By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
I climbed the tree to see the world
When the gusts came around to blow me down
Held on as tightly as you held onto me
Held on as tightly as you held onto me......


And I built a home
for you
for me


Until it disappeared
from me
from you


And now, it's time to leave and turn to dust........


song: Hallelujah
singer: Jeff Buckley
emotions: sad, romantic, soft, wistful


Well I heard there was a secret chord
that David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this
The fourth, the fifth,
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah


Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...


Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah


Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...


Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor (you know)
I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
and love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah


Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...


there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah


Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...


Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah


Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah


song: All I Know
singer: Art Garfunkel
emotions: romantic, soft, sad


I bruise you, you bruise me
We both bruise too easily
Too easily to let it show
I love you and that's all I know
All my plans have fallen through
All my plans depend on you
Depend on you to help them grow
I love you and that's all I know
When the singer's gone
Let the song go on
But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast but they pass too slow
I love you and that's all I know
When the singer's gone
Let the song go on
It's a fine line between the darkness and the dawn
They say in the darkest night, there's a light beyond
But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast but they pass to slow
I love you and that's all I know
That's all I know
That's all I know


song: Samson
singer: Regina Spektor
emotions: romantic, sad


You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first, I loved you first
Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth
I have to go, I have to go
Your hair was long when we first met
Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
He ate a slice of wonder bread
And went right back to bed
And history books forgot about us
And the Bible didn't mention us
The Bible didn't mention us
Not even once
You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first, I loved you first
Beneath the stars came falling on our heads
But they're just old light, they're just old light
Your hair was long when we first met
Samson came to my bed
Told me that my hair was red
He told me I was beautiful
And came into my bed
Oh, I cut his hair myself one night
A pair of dull scissors and the yellow light
And he told me that I'd done alright
And kissed me till the morning light, the morning light
And he kissed me till the morning light
Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
Ate a slice of wonderbread
And went right back to bed
Oh, we couldn't bring the columns down
Yeah, we couldn't destroy a single one
And history books forgot about us
And the Bible didn't mention us
Not even once
You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first


song: Heartbeats
singer: Jose Gonzalez
emotions: sad, romantic, soft


One night to be confused
One night to speed up truth
We had a promise made
Four hands and then away


Both under influence
We had divine scent
To know what to say
Mind is a razor blade


To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no


One night of magic rush
The start a simple touch
One night to push and scream
And then relief


Ten days of perfect tunes
The colors red and blue
We had a promise made
We were in love


To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no


To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough


And you, you knew the hands of the devil
And you, kept us awake with wolf teeth
Sharing different heartbeats
In one night


To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no


To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no


song: Fire
band: Augustana
emotions: sad, soft


No, it don't come easy
No, it don't come fast
Lock me up inside your garden
Take me to the riverside


emotions: strong, love
Fire, burning me up
Desire, taking me so much higher
And leaving me whole


There you were in your black dress
Moving slow to the sadness
I could watch you dance for hours
I could take you by my side


emotions: strong, love
Fire, burning me up
Desire, taking me so much higher
And leaving me
Fire, turning me on
Desire, taking me so much higher
And leaving me whole


song: Twenty Years
band: Augustana
emotions: sad, soft, romantic


Well I've been running from something
Twenty years in my car
Down a road that's leading me nowhere
Yeah we drive through the farmland
No one knows where we're from
Could I kiss you and make you a queen?
Or something in between


Do you want to see it?
The place where I am free?
Cos in my mind I need it
But you're nowhere near to me


Move to New York City
Take your woman by the hand
Leave her there with your things on the doorstep
And there's no way around it
Could this be our last dance?
Just fall asleep with the TV darling
I'll be back again


Do you want to see it?
The place where I was free?
Cos in my mind I've been there
And there's no one here but me


In the morning it'll find you
Let the light shine away
Down a road that's leading me nowhere
And there's no way around it
Could this be our last dance?
Just fall asleep with the TV darling
I'll be back again


song: This Years Love
singer: David Gray
emotions: love, soft


This years love had better last
Heaven knows it's high time
And I've been waiting on my own too long
But when you hold me like you do
It feels so right
I start to forget
How my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feeling like you can't go on


Turning circles when time again
It cuts like a knife oh yeah
If you love me got to know for sure
Cos it takes something more this time
Than sweet sweet lies
Before I open up my arms and fall
Losing all control
Every dream inside my soul
And when you kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet


This years love had better last
This years love had better last


So whose to worry
If our hearts get torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Don't you know this life goes on
And won't you kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet


This years love had better last
This years love had better last
This years love had better last
This years love had better last


song: Aint No Reason
singer: Brett Dennen
emotions: sad, soft, love


There ain't no reason things are this way.
It's how they always been and they intend to stay.
I can't explain why we live this way.
We do it every day.


Preachers on the podium speaking of saints.
Prophets on the sidewalk begging for change.
Old ladies laughing from the fire escape,
Cursing my name.


I gotta a basket full of lemons and they all taste the same,
A window and a pigeon with a broken wing,
You can spend your whole life working for something,
Just to have it taken away.


People walk around pushing back their debts,
Wearing paychecks like necklaces and bracelets,
Talking about nothing, not thinking about death,
Every little heartbeat, every little breath.


People walk a tightrope on a razors edge.
Carrying their hurt and hatred and weapons.
It could be a bomb, or a bullet, or a pen,
Or a thought, or a word, or a sentence.


There ain't no reason things are this way.
Its how they've always been and they intend to stay.
I don't know why I say the things I say,
But I say them anyway.


But love will come set me free.
Love will come set me free, I do believe.
Love will come set me free, I know it will.
Love will come set me free, yes.


Prison walls still standing tall.
Some things never change at all.
Keep on building prisons, gonna fill them all.
Keep on building bombs, gonna drop them all.


Working your fingers bare to the bone.
Breaking' your back, make you sell your soul.
Like a lung, it's filled with coal,
Suffocating slow.


The wind blows wild and I may move.
But politicians lie and I am not fooled.
You don't need no reason or a three piece suit,
To argue the truth.


The air on my skin and the world under my toes
Slavery stitched into the fabric of my clothes
Chaos and commotion wherever I go,
Love I try to follow.


Love will come set me free
Love will come set me free, I do believe
Love will come set me free, I know it will
Love will come set me free, yes


There ain't no reason things are this way.
Its how they've always been and they intend to stay.
I can't explain why we live this way.
We do it every day.


song: Such Great Heights
band: Iron and Wine
emotions: wistful, soft, romantic


I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes
Are mirror images and when we kiss
They're perfectly aligned


And I have to speculate
That God himself did make us
Into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay


And true it may seem like a stretch
But it's thoughts like this that catch
My troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death


When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home


They will see us waving from such great heights
Come down now, they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
Come down now but we'll stay


I've tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat
It sounded thin upon listening


And that frankly will not fly
You'll hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home


They will see us waving from such great heights
Come down now, they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
Come down now but we'll stay


song: The Book Of Love
singer: Peter Gabriel
emotions: romantic, soft


The book of love is long and boring
No one can lift the damn thing
It's full of charts and facts, some figures and instructions for dancing


But I,
I love it when you read to me.
And you,
You can read me anything.


The book of love has music in it,
In fact that's where music comes from.
Some of it is just transcendental,
Some of it is just really dumb.


But I,
I love it when you sing to me.
And you,
You can sing me anything.


The book of love is long and boring,
And written very long ago.
It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes,
And things we're all too young to know.


But I,
I love it when you give me things.
And you,
You ought to give me wedding rings.


And I,
I love it when you give me things.
And you,
You ought to give me wedding rings.
You ought to give me wedding rings.


song: Anyone Else But You
band: The Moldy Peaches
emotions: wistful, romantic, soft


You're a part time lover and a full time friend
The monkey on your back is the latest trend
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of the train
I kiss you all starry eyed, my body's swinging from side to side
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you
Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So why can't you forgive me?
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you
I will find my nitch in your car
With my MP3, DVD, rumple-packed guitar
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you
Du, du, du
Du, du, du
Du, du, du
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B A start
Just because we use cheats doesn't mean we're not smart
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you
You are always trying to keep it real
I'm in love with how you feel
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you
We both have shiny happy fits of rage
You want more fans, I want more stage
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you
Don Quixote was a steel driving man
My name is Adam, I'm your biggest fan
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you
Squinched up your face and did a dance
You shook a little turd out of the bottom of your pants
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else but you
Du, du, du
Du, du, du
Du, du, du
But you


song: Hide and Seek
singer: Imogen Heap
emotions: sad, soft


Where are we? What the hell is going on?
The dust has only just begun to fall,
Crop circles in the carpet, sinking, feeling.
Spin me 'round again and rub my eyes.
This can't be happening.
When busy streets amass with people
Would stop to hold their heads heavy.


Hide and seek.
Trains and sewing machines.
All those years they were here first.


Oily marks appear on walls
Where pleasure moments hung before.
The takeover, the sweeping insensitivity of this still life.


Hide and seek.
Trains and sewing machines. (Oh, you won't catch me around here)
Blood and tears,
They were here first.


Mmm, what you say?
Mm, that you only meant well? Well, of course you did.
Mmm, what you say?
Mm, that it's all for the best? Of course it is.
Mmm, what you say?
Mm, that it's just what we need? And you decided this.
What you say?
Mmm, what did you say?


Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth.
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs.
Speak no feeling, no I don't believe you.
You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit.


(hide and seek)
Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth.
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs.
(hide and seek)
Speak no feeling, no I don't believe you.
You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit.


(hide and seek)
You don't care a bit.
You don't care a bit.
You don't care a bit.
(hide and seek)
You don't care a bit.
You don't care a bit.


song: The Call - Live in London
singer: Regina Spektor
emotions: sad, soft, romantic


It started out as a feeling
Which then grew into a hope
Which then turned into a quiet thought
Which then turned into a quiet word


emotions: strong, sad
And then that word grew louder and louder
'Til it was a battle cry


I'll come back
When you call me
No need to say goodbye


Just because everything's changing
Doesn't mean it's never been this way before
All you can do is try to know who your friends are
As you head off to the war


emotions: strong, sad
Pick a star on the dark horizon
And follow the light


You'll come back when it's over
No need to say goodbye


You'll come back when it's over
No need to say goodbye


Now we're back to the beginning
It's just a feeling and no one knows yet
But just because they can't feel it too
Doesn't mean that you have to forget


emotions: strong, sad
Let your memories grow stronger and stronger
'Til they're before your eyes


You'll come back
When they call you
No need to say goodbye


You'll come back
When they call you
No need to say goodbye


song: The Promise
singer: Tracy Chapman
emotions: sad, romantic, soft


If you wait for me
then I'll come for you
Although I've traveled far
I always hold a place for you in my heart


If you think of me
If you miss me once in awhile
Then I'll return to you
I'll return and fill that space in your heart


Remembering
Your touch
Your kiss
Your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting


If you dream of me
L like I dream of you
In a place that's warm and dark
In a place where I can feel the beating of your heart


Remembering
Your touch
Your kiss
Your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting


I've longed for you
A and I have desired
To see your face your smile
To be with you wherever you are


Remembering
Your touch
Your kiss
Your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
Please say you'll be waiting


Together again
It would feel so good to be
In your arms
Where all my journeys end
If you can make a promise
If it's one that you can keep
I vow to come for you
If you wait for me


And say you'll hold
A place for me
I in your heart.


song: Re: Stacks
band: Bon Iver
emotions: wistful, romantic, soft


This my excavation and today is Kumran
Everything that happens is from now on
This is pouring rain
This is paralyzed


I keep throwing it down two hundred at a time
It's hard to find it when you knew it
When your money's gone
And you're drunk as hell


On your back with your racks as the stacks as your load
In the back and the racks and the stacks are your load
In the back with your racks and you're unstacking your load


I've twisting to the sun I needed to replace
The fountain in the front yard is rusted out
All my love was down 
In a frozen ground


There's a black crow sitting across from me; his wiry legs are crossed
And he's dangling my keys he even fakes a toss
Whatever could it be
That has brought me to this loss?


On your back with your racks as the stacks as your load
In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load
In the back with your racks and you're unstacking your load


This is not the sound of a new man or crispy realization
It's the sound of the unlocking and the lift away
Your love will be
Safe with me


song: Flightless Bird, American Mouth
band: Iron and Wine
emotions: wistful, soft


I was a quick-wit boy
Diving too deep for coins
All of your street light eyes
Wide on my plastic toys
Then when the cops closed the fair
I cut my long baby hair
Stole me a dog-eared map
And called for you everywhere


Have I found you?
Flightless bird, jealous, weeping
Or lost you?
American mouth
Big pill looming


Now I'm a fat house cat
Nursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide fence cracks
Pissing on magazine photos
Those fishing lures thrown in the cold and clean
Blood of Christ mountain stream


Have I found you?
Flightless bird, grounded, bleeding
Or lost you?
American mouth
Big pill, stuck going down


song: Angeles
singer: Elliott Smith
emotions: sad, soft


Someone's always coming around here
Trailing some new kill
Says "I've seen your picture on a
Hundred-dollar bill"
What's a game of chance to you, 
Here is one Of real skill


So glad to meet you, Angeles


Picking up the ticket shows there's 
Money to be made
Go on, lose the gamble that's the 
History of the trade
Did you add up all the cards left to play
To zero


And sign up with evil, Angeles?


emotions: soft, angry
Don't start me trying now
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh


emotions: soft, angry
'Cause I'm all over it, Angeles


emotions: soft, angry
I can make you satisfied in
Everything you do
All your secret wishes could right
Now be coming true
And be forever with my poison arms


emotions: soft, angry
Around you
No one's gonna fool around with us
No one's gonna fool around with us
So glad to meet'cha, Angeles


song: Delicate
singer: Damien Rice
emotions: sad, romantic, soft


We might kiss when we are alone
When nobody's watching
We might take it home
We might make out when nobody's there
It's not that we're scared
It's just that it's delicate


So why do you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you
Why do you sing with me at all?


We might live like never before
When there's nothing to give
Well how can we ask for more
We might make love in some sacred place
The look on your face is delicate


So why do you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you
Why do you sing with me at all?


So why do you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you
Why do you sing with me at all?


song: Flume
band: Bon Iver
emotions: sad, love, soft


I am my mother's only one
It's enough
I wear my garment so it shows
Now you know


Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon


I am my mother on the wall
With us all
I move in water, shore to shore
Nothing's more


Only love is all maroon
Lapping lakes like leery loons
Leaving rope burns, reddish ruse


Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon


song: Closer
singer: Joshua Radin
emotions: romantic, wistful, soft, sad


So, we're alone again
I wish it were over
we seem to never end
only get closer
to the point where I can take no more


the clouds in your eyes
down your face they pour
won't you be the new one burn to shine
I take the blue ones every time
walk me down your broken line
all you have to do is cry


hush my baby now
your talking is just noise and won't lay me down amongst
your toys in a room where I can take no more


the clouds in your eyes
down your face they pour
won't you be the new one burn to shine
I take the blue ones every time
walk me down your broken line
all you have to do is cry


photographs and brightly colored paper
are your mask you wear in this caper
that is our life
we walk right into the strife
and a tear from your eye brings me home


won't you be the new one burn to shine
I take the blue ones every time
walk me down your broken line
all you have to do is cry


song: Hey Ya!
band: The Blanks
emotions: sad, happy, love


My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sure
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door
Don't try to fight the feeling
Because the thought alone is killing me right now
Thank god for mom and dad
For sticking two together
'Cause we don't know how.


And, Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya


You think you've got it
Ohh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it
Till' there's nothing at all.
We get together
Oh, we get together
But seperate's always better when there's feelings involved.
If what they say is "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, Then what makes, Then what makes, Then what makes,
Love the exception?
So why you, why you
Why you, why you, why you are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here


And, Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya


Hey, alright now
Alright now fellas
Now what's cooler than being cool?
Ice Cold
I can't hear you
I say what's cooler than being cool?
Ice Cold
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, 
Right now ladies
We’re gonna break it down in just a few seconds here
Now don't have me break it down for nothing
Now I wanna see y'all on y'alls baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar,
I am your neighbor


emotions: upbeat, happy
Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it

Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it 
Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it,

song: World Spins Madly On
band: The Weepies
emotions: sad, romantic, soft


Woke up and wished that I was dead
With an aching in my head 
I lay motionless in bed
I thought of you and where you'd gone
and let the world spin madly on


Everything that I said I'd do 
Like make the world brand new
And take the time for you
I just got lost and slept right through the dawn 
And the world spins madly on


emotions: wistful, soft
I let the day go by 
I always say goodbye
I watch the stars from my window sill 
The whole world is moving and I'm standing still


Woke up and wished that I was dead 
With an aching in my head 
I lay motionless in bed
The night is here and the day is gone
And the world spins madly on


I thought of you and where you'd gone 
And the world spins madly on.


song: Me And My Guitar
singer: Tom Dice
emotions: sad, wistful, soft


People always say
Tom, this has gone too far
But I'm not afraid to chase my dreams
Just me and my guitar


And no one may ever know
The feelings inside my mind
'Cause all of the lines I ever write
Are running out of time


So maybe I should get a nine to five
But I don't want to let it go, there's so much more to life


Tell me that I've got it wrong
Tell me everything will be okay
Before I fall
Tell me they'll play my songs
Tell me they'll sing the words I say
When darkness falls
All of the stars will see
Just me and my guitar


I'm sure that I'll find my way
'Cause I'm not afraid to try
Even a world of love and hope can't guarantee that price


So maybe I can get a nine to five
But I don't want to let it go, there's so much more to life


Tell me that I've got it wrong
Tell me everything will be okay
Before I fall
Tell me they'll play my songs
Tell me they'll sing the words I say
When darkness falls
All of the stars will see
Just me and my guitar


Me and my guitar


song: Tell Her This
band: Del Amitri
emotions: romantic, soft, sad


Tell her not to go 
I ain't holding on no more 
Tell her something in my mind freezes up from time to time 


Tell her not to cry 
I just got scared that's all 
Tell her I'll be by her side, all she has to do is call 


Tell her the chips are down 
I drank too much and shouted it aloud 
Tell her something in my heart 
Needs her more than even clowns need the laughter of the crowd 


Tell her what was wrong 
I sometimes think to much 
But say nothing at all 
And tell her from this high terrain, I am ready now to fall 


Tell her not to go 
I ain't holding on no more 
Tell her nothing if not this; all I want to do is kiss her 


Tell her something in my mind 
Freezes up from time to time.

Coffee black and egg white
Pull me out from inside

Taffy stuck, tongue tied 
Stuttered shook and uptight
Pull me out from inside

I am covered in skin
No one gets to come in
Pull me out from inside
I am folded, and unfolded, and unfolding

Pull me out from inside
I am ready

song: Titanium
singer: Sia
emotions: sad, party

You shouted out
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud not saying much
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
Shoot me down, but I get up

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium

Cut me down
But it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud not saying much

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium

Stone-hard, machine gun
Firing at the ones who run
Stone-hard as bulletproof glass

You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium

Here comes the sun (doo doo doo doo)
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right


Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right


Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun

song: Soak Up the Sun
singer: Sheryl Crow
emotions: happy, upbeat


My friend the communist 
Holds meetings in his RV
I can't afford his gas
So I'm stuck here watching TV
I don't have digital
I don't have diddly squat
It's not having what you want
It's wanting what you've got


I'm gonna soak up the sun
Gonna tell everyone 
To lighten up (I'm gonna tell 'em that)
I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
I'm looking up o I'm gonna soak up the sun
I'm gonna soak up the sun
I've got a crummy job
It don't pay near enough
To buy the things it takes
To win me some of your love
Every time I turn around
I'm looking up, you're looking down
Maybe something's wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do
Maybe i am crazy too


I'm gonna soak up the sun
While it's still free
I'm gonna soak up the sun
Before it goes out on me
Don't have no master suite
I'm still the king of me
You have a fancy ride, but baby
I'm the one who has the key
Every time I turn around
I'm looking up, you're looking down
Maybe something's wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do
Maybe I am crazy too 


I'm gonna soak up the sun
Got my 45 on
So I can rock on.


song: Come Away With Me
singer: Norah Jones
emotions: wistful, soft, romantic


Come away with me in the night
Come away with me
And I will write you a song


Come away with me on a bus
Come away where they can't tempt us
With their lies


I want to walk with you 
On a cloudy day
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
So won't you try to come


Come away with me and we'll kiss
On a mountaintop
Come away with me
And I'll never stop loving you


And I want to wake up with the rain
Falling on a tin roof
While I'm safe there in your arms
So all I ask is for you
To come away with me in the night
Come away with me


song: Dont Know Why
singer: Norah Jones
emotions: wistful, soft, love


I waited till I saw the sun
I don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly a way
'Stead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand
My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever
Out across the endless sea
I will die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone
My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever
Something has to make you run
I don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come


song: Forget You
singer: Cee Lo Green
emotions: upbeat, angry


I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like,
Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like,
Forget you!
And forget her too!
Said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shit? (ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a...
Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo


Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari,
But that don't mean I can't get you there.
I guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari,
About the way you play your game ain't fair.


I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh shit she's a gold digger)
Well
(Just thought you should know nigga)
Ooooooh
I've got some news for you
Yeah go run and tell your little boyfriend


Now I know, that I had to borrow,
Beg and steal and lie and cheat.
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya.
'Cause being in love with your a** ain't cheap.


I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh shit she's a gold digger)
Well
(Just thought you should know nigga)
Ooooooh
I've got some news for you
Ooh, I really hate your ass right now




emotions: sad, upbeat
Now baby, baby, baby
Why d'you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my momma but she told me
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Yes she did
And I was like
Uh! Whhhy? Uh! Whhhy? Uh!
Whhhy lady? Oh! I love you oh!

song: I Want You
singer: Cee Lo
emotions: romantic, upbeat


Oh...
Hey Hey Hey Hey...
I want you
I want you


Hey, I love the night life
Yes I do it's so much fun
And before you know it
Ah here comes the sun
Sweetheart it's been real, but...
The thrill is gone


Silence is like a spirit
That picked my house to haunt
But I know it's there so I'm nonchalant
Now the question is just what do I want


And I want you to run away with me and experience something new
Anything you've already done just won't do
I want you
And I want you to genuinely and sincerely want me too
You can believe in my baby
Don't be cruel
'Cause I want you


Would a trip to a remote island ease your mind
Oh you look like a solitaire in the sunshine
I like her 'cause she's fun
She's fearless
She's a friend of mine


Oh I'm not trying to say that you need any help
You can have anything you want with your bad self
I like her 'cause she's smart
But she's still sexy
She is somethin' else


That's why I want you to run away with me and experience something new
Anything you've already done just won't do
I want you
And I want you to genuinely and sincerely want me too
You can believe in my baby, don't be cruel
'Cause I want you


Oh...
Oh one rarely finds a lady
That happens to be three times the lady
God is good
But he took his time when he designed you baby
That's why I want you


And
Oh I'll even quit my job
Lovin' you, I'll make it my job
Thank you Lord, thank you lord
This is it
My god!
That's why I want you

emotions: upbeat, love


It's not that I don't want you baby I really do
I want you to know that I got you on my mind
I don't really know you baby or what you're about
But I saw you bathing naked in the moonlight
With your fingers on my skin we'll commit this sin chin to chin
For the third time if it's still to come


You're the kind of girl I kind of wanna be with
You're the kind of girl I want
You're the kind of girl I kind of wanna be with
You're the kind of girl I want


It's not like I'm obsessed or anything I might be out on a limb here
But two times not enough no to times not enough
I know I'm just a poor skinny boy from Sweden
But you're my neighbor so show me some love
You're my neighbor so show me some love


You're the kind of girl I kind of wanna be with
You're the kind of girl I want
You're the kind of girl I kind of wanna be with
You're the kind of girl I want


It might be a forgery this memory
But if it is then let it be so
Some times when you tell a lie a lot of times
You might believe that it's true
But where does it end do we start a new begin
Where does it end


I know I'm just a poor skinny boy from Sweden
But you're my neighbor so show me some love
You're my neighbor so show me some love


You're the kind of girl I kind of wanna be with
You're the kind of girl I want
You're the kind of girl I kind of wanna be with
You're the kind of girl I want

Oh, what you want, what you need
What'd you come here for?
Well, an eye for an eye and an 'f' for fight
Taking me down as the prisoners riot
Yeah yeah
Got shackles on, my words are tied
Fear can make you compromise
Lights turned up, it's hard to hide
Sometimes I want to disappear
When I feel kinda bad and don't want stress
Just pass it off on ability
Well you got what you want, what you never knew
Perfect gift from me to you
Yeah yeah yeah
Got shackles on, my words are tied
Fear can make you compromise
With the lights turned up, it's hard to hide
Sometimes I want to disappear
(Raise up to your ability)
You never knew that I could find
What could come when we realize
I don't want to compromise
(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah I'm scared but I'll disappear
Running around cause I'm filled with fear
Nothing good cause my life's a wreck
(Raise up to your ability)
I know that you wanna
Throw me into the Sea
For my ability
(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah I'm undecided
Yeah just want to leave you
I don't wanna run away
You gotta focus on your ability
Focus on your ability
You gotta focus on your ability
Focus on your ability

Can't get what they want to steal
Then they can't get what they want to steal
Can't get what they want to steal

Robert's got a quick hand.
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan.
He's got a rolled cigarette hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid.
Yeah, he found a six shooter gun in his dad's closet hidden with a box of fun things.
And I don't even know what but he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you.


All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, outrun my gun.
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run faster than my bullet.


Dad – he works a long day.
He'll be coming home late, he's coming home late.
And he's bringing me a dark surprise.
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice.
I've waited for a long time.
Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger.
I reason with my cigarette
And say, "Your hair's on fire, you must have lost your wits, yeah."


All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, outrun my gun.
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run faster than my bullet.


Ru-ru-run, run, run, run


All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, outrun my gun.
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run faster than my bullet.

Sometimes life it takes you by the hair, pulls you down
Before you know it, it's gone and you're dead again
I've been in places and I won't pretend
That I'd make it out just to fall on my head
Wake up strange I take the walk downstairs
Hit the pawn up on the corner and pay for my rent
You know that I could not believe my own truth
Just show them what I choose, got nothing to lose
Yeah yeah and it's O.K.
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison but I'll hold on tight
You know those days when you want to just choose
To not get out of bed, you're lost in your head again
You play the game but you're kind of cut
'cause you're coming down hard and your joints are all stuck
I've tried to say that it's not the only way
I never knew if I could face myself to change
You were impatient, I was insecure
Slip and fall, I'm dodging calls, in the prison I've been living in
Yeah yeah and it's O.K.
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison but I'll hold on tight
Yeah yeah and it's O.K.
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah yeah and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison but I'll hold on tight


song: Jailhouse Rock
singer: Elvis Presley
emotions: upbeat, happy


The warden threw a party in the county jail.
The prison band was there and they began to wail.
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing.
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing.
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.


Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone,
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone.
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang,
the whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang.
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.


Number forty-seven said to number three:
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see.
I sure would be delighted with your company,
come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me."
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.


The sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone
way over in the corner weepin' all alone.
The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square.
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair."
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.


Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake,
no one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break."
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix,
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks."
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.

emotions: upbeat, party


A little less conversation, a little more action please

A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me

Drifting through a summer breeze
Its a groovy night and I can show you how to use it
Come along with me and put your mind at ease


A little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation aint satisfactioning me

emotions: love, upbeat


Lord almighty,
I feel my temperature rising
Higher higher
Its burning through to my soul


Girl, girl, girl
You gonna set me on fire
My brain is flaming
I don't know which way to go


Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love


Ooh, ooh, ooh,
I feel my temperature rising
Help me, Im flaming
I must be a hundred and nine
Burning, burning, burning
And nothing can cool me
I just might turn into smoke
But I feel fine


Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
And you light my morning sky
With burning love


Its coming closer
The flames are reaching my body
Please wont you help me
I feel like Im slipping away
Its hard to breath
And my chest is a-heaving


Lord almighty,
Im burning a hole where I lay
Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love
With burning love
Ah, ah, burning love
Im just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love

song: Paranoid
band: Black Sabbath
emotions: angry


Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind 
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time 
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy 
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify 
Can you help me occupy my brain? 
Oh yeah 
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find 
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind 
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry 
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal 
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state 
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late


song: Iron Man
band: Black Sabbath
emotions: angry


Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all,
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
why should we even care?


He was turned to steel
in the great magnetic field
When he travelled time
for the future of mankind


Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
that he will soon unfurl


Now the time is here
for Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved


Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge


Heavy boots of lead
fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!


song: Bother
band: Stone Sour
emotions: angry, sad


Wish I was too dead to cry
My self-affliction fades
Stones to throw at my creator
Masochists to which I cater
You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be 
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on,
I won't let go 'til it bleeds


Wish I was too dead to care
If indeed I cared at all
Never had a voice to protest
So you fed me shit to digest
I wish I had a reason;
my flaws are open season
For this, I gave up trying
One good turn deserves my dying


You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on,
I won't let go 'til it bleeds


Wish I'd died instead of lived
A zombie hides my face
Shell forgotten
with its memories
Diaries left
with cryptic entries


And you don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on,
I won't let go 'til it bleeds


You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on:
I'll never live down my deceit


song: Live in This City
band: Dragonette
emotions: upbeat, happy


I start it up
Turn it over like a general motor
And come down heavy
'Cause I drop it like a Tomahawk chopper


I gotta keep on doing what I'm doing
'Cause we're clapping our hands now
Yeah I found a lipstick that I like
And so I'm walking it downtown, downtown


But I only live in this city
Live in the city
I only live in this city
Live in the city
I like to keep the place busy and I do it for free
Cause this city can't live without me
Can't live without


Me and my gang and some blonde defender
We wind it up around the center, roll it over to Camden
Just so you know that queen with the face that you call my little pony
We basically invented this place,
That's why it's standing room only
Standing room only


But I only live in this city
Live in the city
I only live in this city
Live in the city
I like to keep the place busy and I do it for free
Cause this city can't live without me
Can't live without

Riots and rebel rousers
High roller phantom powers

emotions: upbeat, party


I heard you on my wireless back in '52
Lyin' awake intent on tuning in on you
If I was young it didn't stop you coming through
oh-a-oh
They took the credit for your second symphony
Rewritten by machine on new technology
And now I understand the supernova scene
oh-a-oh
I met your children
oh-a-oh
What did you tell them?
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Pictures came and broke your heart,
we can't rewind we've gone too far
Whoa!
Oh - aoh – oh - oh – oh
Oh – aoh – oh - oh - oh
And now we meet in an abandoned studio
You hear the playback and it seems so long ago
And you remember, the jingles used to go,
oh-a-oh
You were the first one
oh-a-oh
You were the last one
Video killed the radio star

Pictures came and broke your heart,

Alright
Video killed the radio star

Pictures came and broke your heart,

Put all the blame on VCR
You are... the radio star

Video killed that radio star, yes it did

you're going to get what you deserve.

God money's not looking for the cure.
God money's not concerned with the sick amongst the pure.
God money let's go dancing on the backs of the bruised.
God money's not one to choose


you know who you are.

Hey, Akon
I'm looking at you, I'm looking at my girl
And it's making me wanna go and question
What I'ma do with you in my world
When I just replace you with that blessing
But I don't know, I can just hear you talking
About your good sex lessons
Need you to show me that weapon
Otherwise I can just keep on steppin', girl
You hear there was a party
Tonight and I'd be here
I just saw you lookin' at me
Even though she's here
Every time I turn around
You seem to be worried about me
(Is dat right?)
What about me?
(Is dat right, girl?)
I can settle down for the things you like
I'm a girl who can take the lead
But I'm still the fall back type
Give you the space you need
Even though I can't explain
How I do the damn thang
I would put it on my life that I
I'll do it better than her
I'll do it better than her
I'll do it better than her

Say hey, hey, hey
Everyone together now
Hey, hey, hey
If you can do it better say
Hey, hey, hey
(Bring it down)
You showed up to the party
For all the wrong reasons
She said if you look over again
That she's leavin'
I don't really feel so bad
Cause I know ya better without her
(Is dat right?)
What about her?
(Is dat right, girl?)
You settle down for the things you like
I'm a girl who can take the lead
But I'm still the fall back type
I'll give you what you need
And even though I can't explain
How I do the damn thang
I can show you tonight
I'll do it better than her
I'll do it better than her

Say hey, hey, hey
Everyone together now
Hey, hey, hey
If you can do it better say
Hey, hey, hey
Not only did you come back
And throw that body on me
But you made my eyes see a miracle, miracle
Now I got to decide to do the right thing
Like I was Spike Lee
Tell me would you allow her
To break you off
Break you off
Shake it on me, shake it on me
Shake it on me
Go ahead and break it on me
Girl, just make a statement on me
Shake it on me, shake it on me
Shake it on me
Go ahead, now break it on me
Girl, just make a statement on me
Hey, hey, hey

emotions: upbeat, love


The moon was shinin' on the lake that night.
The Slayer t-shirt fit the scene just right.
Through smeared mascara, I looked into your eyes and saw a light.
You told me stories about your chickadees
They didn't like BB guns or stupid archery.
You charmed the lifeguard, he let them use the pool all day for free.
Then the conversation stopped and I looked down at my feet.
I was next to you and you were right there next to me.
Then I said, 'go! If you're wondering if I want you to, I want you to.
So make the move. Cause I ain't got all night.
The rest of the summer was the best we ever had.
We watched Titanic and it didn't make us sad.
I took you to Best Buy, you took me home to meet your mom and dad.
Your mom cooked meatloaf even though I don't eat meat.
I dug you so much I took some for the team.
Your dad was silent. His eyes were fixed to what was on TV.
Then the conversation stopped and I looked down at the ring.
Your folks were next to you and you were right there next to me.
Then I said, 'Girl! If you're wondering if I want you to, I want you to.
I swear it's true. Without you, my heart is blue.
Oooh whoa Girl! If you're wondering if I want you to, I want you to.
So make a move. Cause I ain't got all night.'
So much pain may come our way.
There may come a day when we have nothing left to say.
When the conversation stops and we're facing our defeat.
I'll be next to you and you'll be right there next to me.
Then I'll say, 'Girl! If you're wondering if I want you to, I want you to.
I swear it's true. Without you my heart is blue.
Oooh whoa Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to, I want you to.
So make a move. Cause I ain't got all night.'

And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain

When you're on a golden sea
You don't need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone


On an island in the sun
We'll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain


We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore

Guess I'll just close my eyes 


Oh yeah
Alright
Feels good
Inside 


Flip on the tele
Wrestle with Jimmy
Something is bubbling
Behind my back
The bottle is ready to blow 


Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life taker 


I can't confront you
I never could do
That which might hurt you
So try and be cool
When I say
This way is a waterslide away from me
That takes you further every day
So be cool 


Say it ain't so

My love is a life taker 


Dear Daddy
I write you in spite of years of silence
You've cleaned up, found Jesus, things are good or so I hear
This bottle of Steven's awakens ancient feelings
Like father, stepfather, the son is drowning in the flood
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Say it ain't so

song: You Dont Know Me
singer: Ben Folds
emotions: upbeat, love, angry


I wanna ask you do you ever sit and wonder?
It's so strange we could be together for
So long and never know never care
What goes on in the other one's head
Things I felt but I never said
You said things that I never said so
I'll say something that I should have said long ago
You don't know me, you don't know me at all
You don't know me, you don't know me at all
You could have just propped me up on the table like a mannequin
Or a cardboard stand up and paint me
Any face that you wanted me to be seen with
Damned by the existential moment where
We saw the couple in the coma
And it was we who were the clich
But we carried on anyway
So sure I can just close my eyes
Yeah sure, trace and memorize
But can you go back once you know
You don't know me, you don't know me at all
You don't know me, you don't know me at all
You don't know me, you don't know me at all
You don't know me, you don't know me
If I'm the person that you think I am
Clueless chump you seem to think I am
So easily led astray
An errant dog who occasionally escapes
And needs a shorter leash then
Why the fuck would you want me back?
Maybe it's because
You don't know me at all
You don't know me, you don't know me
So what I'm trying to say is
What I'm trying to tell you is
Not gonna come out like I wanna say it
'Cause I know you'll only change it, say it
You don't know me, you don't know me at all
You don't know me, you don't know me at all
You don't know me, you don't know me at all
You don't know me, you don't know me at all
What?

in a few weeks, I will get time
To realize it's right before my eyes
And I can take it, if it's what I want to do
I am leaving, this is starting
To feel like it's right before my eyes
And I can taste it, it's my sweet beginning
And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time
Maybe next year I'll have no time
To think about the questions to address
Am I the one to try to stop the fire?
I wouldn't test you
I'm not the best you could have attained
Why try anything?
I will get there, just remember I know
And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time
And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time


song: More than a Feeling
band: Boston
emotions: upbeat, sad


I looked out this morning and the sun was gone 
Turned on some music to start my day 
I lost myself in a familiar song 
I closed my eyes and I slipped away 


It's more than a feeling 
(More than a feeling) 
When I hear that old song they used to play 
(More than a feeling) 
I begin dreaming 
(More than a feeling) 
'Til I see Marianne walk away 
I see my Marianne walkin' away 


So many people have come and gone 
Their faces fade as the years go by 
Yet I still recall as I wander on 
As clear as the sun in the summer sky 


It's more than a feeling 
(More than a feeling) 
When I hear that old song they used to play 
(More than a feeling) 
I begin dreaming 
(More than a feeling) 
'Til I see Marianne walk away 
I see my Marianne walkin' away 


When I'm tired and thinking cold 
I hide in my music, forget the day 
And dream of a girl I used to know 
I closed my eyes and she slipped away 
She slipped away 


It's more than a feeling 
(More than a feeling) 
When I hear that old song they used to play 
(More than a feeling) 
I begin dreaming 
(More than a feeling)

In the light of the sun, is there anyone? Oh it has begun...
Oh dear you look so lost, eyes are red and tears are shed,
This world you must've crossed... she said...


You don't know me, you don't even care, oh yeah,
She said
You don't know me, and you don't wear my chains... oh yeah,


Essential yet appealed, carry all your thoughts across
An open field,
When flowers gaze at you... they're not the only ones who cry
When they see you
She said...


You don't know me, you don't even care, oh yeah,
She said
You don't know me, and you don't wear my chains... oh yeah,


She said I think I'll go to Boston...
I think I'll start a new life,
I think I'll start it over, where no one knows my name,
I'll get out of California, I'm tired of the weather,
I think I'll get a lover and fly him out to Spain...
Oh yeah and I think I'll go to Boston,
I think that I'm just tired
I think I need a new town, to leave this all behind...
I think I need a sunrise, I'm tired of the sunset,
I hear it's nice in the Summer, some snow would be nice... oh yeah,


You don't know me, you don't even care, oh yeah...


Boston... where no one knows my name... yeah
Where no one knows my name...
Where no one knows my name...
Boston...
No one knows my name.


song: Time to Pretend
band: MGMT
emotions: party, upbeat, sad


I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw, I'm in the prime of my life.
Let's make some music, make some money, find some models for wives.
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin, and fuck with the stars.
You man the island and the cocaine and the elegant cars.


This is our decision, to live fast and die young.
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun.
Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do.
Get jobs in offices, and wake up for the morning commute.


Forget about our mothers and our friends
We're fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend


I'll miss the playgrounds and the animals and digging up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother and the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister, miss my father, miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom and the time spent alone.


There's really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew.
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run it's course.


We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
We were fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend


Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

(Come On Eileen)
(Come On Eileen)


Poor old Johnny Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
But he moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along
Who'd blame them
You've grown, so grown
Now I must say more than ever
(Come On Eileen)
Too-ra-loo-ra, too-ra-loo-rye, aye
And we can sing just like our fathers


Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear what he means (what he means)
At this moment you mean everything
You in that dress
My thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty
Oh, come on Eileen


(Come On Eileen)


These people round here
Wear beaten down eyes sunk
In smoke dried faces
They're so resigned to what their fate is
But not us (no not ever)
But not us (not ever)
We are far too young and clever
(Remember)
Too-ra-loo-ra, too-ra-loo-rye, aye
And you'll hum this tune forever


Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear what he means
Aah, come on let's
Take off everything
That pretty red dress
Eileen (tell him yes)
Aah, come on let's
Aah, come on Eileen


That pretty red dress
Eileen (tell him yes)
Aah, come on let's
Aah, come on Eileen


Come on Eileen, too-rye-aye
Come on Eileen, too-rye-aye
Now you're full grown
Now you have shown
Oh, Eileen


Say, come on Eileen
These things they are real and I know
How you feel
Now I must say more than ever
Things round here have changed
I say, too-ra-loo-ra, too-ra-loo-rye-aye


Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (what he means)
At this moment, you mean everything
You in that dress, my thoughts I confess
Which are dirty
Aah, come on Eileen


Aah, come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (what he means)
At this moment, you mean everything
You in that dress, my thoughts I confess
Well, they're dirty
Come on Eileen


Come on Eileen…

song: Only the Good Die Young
singer: Billy Joel
emotions: upbeat, love, happy


Come out Virginia, don't let me me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
But sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
They showed you a statue and told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
But they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done...
Only the good die young


You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
But that never hurt no one
Come on Virginia show me a sign
Send up a signal I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun
Darling, only the good die young


You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
And a cross of gold
But Virginia they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary


They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
Sinners are much more fun...
You know that only the good die young


You say your mother told you all that I could give you was a reputation
She never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me?


song: Lights
singer: Ellie Goulding
emotions: party, wistful


I had a way then losing it all on my own
I had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now, the dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now, the strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
Home
Voices, I play within my head
Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when my brother of my sister slept
In an unknown place the only time I feel safe
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
Home
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
(Home, home)
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
Home
(Home, home )
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
(Home, home)
Lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights

They say I need some Rogaine to put in my hair
Work it out at the gym to fit my underwear
Oakley makes the shades that transform a tool
You'd hate for the kids to think that you lost your cool


emotions: strong, angry, upbeat
I'ma do the things that I wanna do
I ain't got a thing to prove to you
I eat my candy with the pork and beans
Excuse my manners if I make a scene
I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you'll like
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink
I don't give a hoot about what you think


Everyone likes to dance to a happy song
With a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along
Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the chart
Maybe if I work with him I can perfect the art


emotions: strong, angry, upbeat
I'ma do the things that I wanna do
I ain't got a thing to prove to you

I'm fine and dandy with the me inside
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink
I don't give a hoot about what you think

So sentimental, not sentimental no
Romantic not discusting yet
Darling, I'm down and lonely when with the fortunate only
I've been looking for something else
Do let, do let, do let, jugulate, do let, do let, do
Let's go slowly discouraged
Distant from other interests on your favorite weekend ending
This love's for gentlemen only that's with the fortunate only
No, I gotta be someone else
These days it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes and goes


emotions: upbeat, party
Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow like a riot, like a riot, oh
I'm not easily offended
It's not hard to let it go from a mess to the masses
Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow like a riot, like a riot, oh
I'm not easily offended
It's not hard to let it go from a mess to the masses


Follow, misguide, stand still
Discuss, discourage on this precious weekend ending
This love's for gentlemen only, wealthiest gentlemen only
And now that you're lonely
Do let, do let, do let, juggle it, do let, do let, do
Let's go slowly discouraged, we'll burn the pictures instead
When it's all over we can barely discuss
For one minute only, not with the fortunate only
Thought it could have been something else
These days it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes and goes


emotions: upbeat, party
Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow like a riot, like a riot, oh
I'm not easily offended
It's not hard to let it go from a mess to the masses

Think less but see it grow like a riot, like a riot, oh
I'm not easily offended
It's not hard to let it go from a mess to the masses
This is show time, this is show time, this is show time
This is show time, this is show time, this is show time
Time
Time to show it off time to show it off now it's time to show it off
Time
Time to show it off time to show it off now it's time to show it off
From the mess to the masses
Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow like a riot, like a riot, oh
Discuss, discuss, discuss
Discuss, discuss, discouraged

And she spoke words of wisdom


To the basement people, to the basement, many surprises await you
In the basement, people, in the basement


You hid there last time, you know we're gonna find you
Sick in the carseat, cause you're not up to going
Out on the main streets, completing your mission

Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid
You're never satisfied


Here we go again
We're sick like animals
We play pretend
You're just
A cannibal
And I'm afraid
I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight


Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight


Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's getting heavy
And I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide


I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you


Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight


Hush, hush, the world is quiet
Hush, hush, we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Whoa, I won't sleep tonight
I won't sleep tonight


Here we go again


Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting?


Here we go again, oh, oh
Say goodbye to my heart tonight


Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight


song: Everybody Talks

emotions: party, upbeat, strong, love


Hey baby won't you look my way?
I can be your new addiction
Hey baby what you gotta say?
All you're giving me is fiction


I'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time
I found out that everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks


It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can't even chitchat
Take me to your love shack
Mamas always gotta backtrack
When everybody talks back


Hey honey you could be my drug
You could be my new prescription
Too much could be an overdose
All this trash talk make me itching


Oh my my shit
Everybody talks, everybody talks
Everybody talks too much


It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can't even chitchat
Take me to your love shack
Mamas always gotta backtrack
When everybody talks back


Never thought I'd live to see the day
When everybody's words got in the way


Hey sugar show me all your love
All you're giving me is friction
Hey sugar what you gotta say?


It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can't even chitchat
Take me to your love shack
Mamas always gotta backtrack
When everybody talks back


Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks... back


It started with a whisper (everybody talks, everybody talks)
And that was when I kissed her (everybody talks, everybody talks)


Everybody talks
Everybody talks... back
