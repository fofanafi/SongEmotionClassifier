song: Pieces
band: Hoobastank
emotions: sad


Turn around and pick up the pieces
I, like a rock, sink
Sinking til I hit the bottom
The water is much deeper than I thought
Nothing to swim with
Kicking but I keep sinking
A lesson that no one could have ever taught
Cause I can almost breathe the air
Right beyond my fingertips
I'll turn around and pick up the pieces
One more push and I'll be there
Back where I belong
I'll turn around and pick up the pieces
I see the picture
Blurry but now it's in focus
A fairy tale I purchased on my own
I finally woke up
Everything is better
A chance for me to open up and grow
I can almost breathe the air
Right beyond my fingertips
I'll turn around and pick up the pieces
One more push and I'll be there
Back where I belong
I'll turn around and pick up the pieces
Suffocating sinking further almost everyday
Barely treading water knowing I will not give up
I will not give up
I will not give up
I can almost breathe the air
Right beyond my fingertips
I'll turn around and pick up the pieces
One more push and I'll be there
Back where I belong
I'll turn around and pick up the pieces
Turn around and pick up the pieces


song: The Reason
band: Hoobastank
emotions: regretful, love


I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know


I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
and the reason is you


I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
Thats why I need you to hear


I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
and the reason is You
and the reason is You
I'm not a perfect person
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know


I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
and the reason is you


I've found a reason to show
A side of me you didn't know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you


song: Collide
singer: Howie Day
emotions: wistful, love


The dawn is breaking
A light shining through
You're barely waking
And I'm tangled up in you
Yeah


I'm open, you're closed
Where I follow, you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again


Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find
You and I collide


I'm quiet you know
You make a first impression
I've found I'm scared to know I'm always on your mind


Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the stars refuse to shine
Out of the back you fall in time
I somehow find
You and I collide


Don't stop here
I lost my place
I'm close behind


Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find
You and I collide


You finally find
You and I collide
You finally find
You and I collide


song: Weightless
singer: Howie Day
emotions: wistful, love


I was alone, so not afraid
I was staying up with you way too late
I thought someone like you
Could come around n make my faults
Seem like they were none at all
Come on somebody help me out
I'm underwater drowned in doubt


But it feels just like we're weightless
Weightless when we're together
Isn't it time to face it, what we already know?
Seems just like we fake it
Pretend it isn't happening
Pretend that it'll go away
Oh but what do I know?


It was all mixed up, ahead of the curve
When you were lying to the world
See I want to lie there too
Feeling down n all around
I see your back in every town
You'll be the one to hold me down
Tell me, is it too late now?


Cuz it feels just like we're weightless
Weightless when we're together
Isn't it time to face it, what we already know?
Seems just like we fake it
Pretend it isn't happening
Pretend that it'll go away
Oh but what do I know?


I want to be alive like you
Be so easy like you
I want to love like you do
Oh wonderous one


It feels just like we're weightless
Weightless when we're together
Isn't it time to face it, what we already know?
Seems just like we fake it
Pretend it isn't happening
Pretend that it'll go away


It feels just like we're weightless
Weightless when we're together
Isn't it time to face it, what we already know?
Feels just like we're turning
Turning ourselves in circles
Pretend that we can find a way
Oh but what do I know?


But what do I know?
Oh.. but what do I know?

Uh-huh huh huhhh

Uh-huh
(Mmhhmmm)


emotions: regretful
When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look


emotions: sad, regretful
Oh baby, give me one more chance

emotions: love, sad
Trying to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl I didn't even want around


emotions: love, regretful
Let me tell ya now
Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me back in your heart

To show you that I love you
Baby baby baby baby baby baby!

Forget what happened then
(I want you back)
And let me live again!


emotions: love, regretful
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back)
Spare me of this cause
(I want you back)
Give me back what I lost!

song: Come Clean
singer: Hilary Duff
emotions: wistful


Let's go back
Back to the beginning
Back to when the earth, the sun, the stars all aligned


'Cause perfect didn't feel so perfect
Trying to fit a square into a circle
was my life
I defy


Let the rain fall down
And wake my dreams
Let it wash away
My sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder
I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean, I'm coming clean


I'm shedding
Shedding every color
Trying to find a pigment of truth
Beneath my skin


'Cause different
Doesn't feel so different
And going out is better
Then always staying in
Feel the wind


I'm coming clean
Let the rain fall
Let the rain fall
I'm coming...
Let's go back
Back to the beginning


song: Party Up
singer: Hilary Duff
emotions: love, party


You are driving me out of my mind
'Cause you take me everywhere but out at night
What more do you need for me to get with you


I didn't see this coming
Why don't you start me up?
There's no more messin' around
(Come on and light me up)
This could be the start of something
Why don't you party-up
Time for you to come on down


I dream about it in my sleep
You seem to like me better when I creep
This time I won't lose


You roll me, you use me, you love me and then
You wrap me up and reel me in and use me again
You love me, you hate me, you say it's the end
I know you're gonna do it again and again…

Have you ever stood outside a picket fence
You can see through
But you can't get to the inside, oh
You sit there and wait
I look at you and anticipate
What we could be and what we could do


Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time


I'm carrying this heavy load
Don't know what to do
The only thing I know
Is I'm in love with you
Fly with the wings of an eagle
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you


Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time


No matter how high, no matter how low

Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
Oh


Fly the wings of an eagle
No matter how high

song: Knock You Down
singer: Keri Hilson
emotions: love, upbeat


Keep rockin', and keep knockin'
Whether you Louis Vuitton-ed up or Reebok-in'
You see the hate, that they're servin' on a platter
So what we gon' have - dessert or disaster?


I never thought I'd... be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
And you came in... and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race
But I... already won first place


I never thought I'd... fall for you as hard as I did
(As hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinkin' about our life, our house and kids (yeah)
Every morning I look at you and smile
Cause boy you came around and you knocked me down... knocked me down


Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)


I've never thought I
Would hear myself say (ooh)
Ya'll go ahead
I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today (Kick it with my girl today)
I used to be commander and chief
Of my pimp ship flyin' high (flyin' high)
'Til I met this pretty little missile who shot me out the sky (oh shot me out the sky)


(Hey) 'til now I'm crashing, I don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back, and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby if I could
Miss independent (oh, to the fullest), the load never to much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight


Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)


Tell me now can you make it past your caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
To seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that, always kept you laughin'
We, were never meant to be baby we just happened
So please, don't mess up the trick... hey young world I'm the new slick rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let the moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess have asked someone that's only average
For advice
O.M.G, you listen to that, bitch?
Woe is me
Baby this is tragic
Cause we had it, we was magic


I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm a ask him


So I gotta put the good with the bad, happy and the sad
So I'll bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh Cause, I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
Whoa, whoa
I'll admit it, I I was scared to answer loves call
Whoa, whoa
And if it hits better make it worth the fall
(When it comes around)


Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(Knocks you down)


Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love come and knocks you down (oh)


Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down (yeah)


song: Greatest Love Of All
singer: Whitney Houston
emotions: love


I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be


Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me


I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all


I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be


And if, by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love


song: I Wanna Dance With Somebody
singer: Whitney Houston


emotions: sad
Clocks strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls loneliness calls


emotions: happy, party
Oh! Wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! Wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me


emotions: sad
I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Soon or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls


song: Where Do Broken Hearts Go
singer: Whitney Houston


emotions: sad, love
I know it's been some time
But there's something on my mind
You see, I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day...
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only thing I learned
Is that I need you desperately...
So here I am
And can you please tell me... oh


emotions: sad, love
Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me


emotions: love, sad
I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No you just can't run away...
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind


emotions: love
And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know...


song: My Love
singer: Whitney Houston
emotions: love


My love
Some girl just wanna spend guys money
Live their lives chasing the milk or honey
Silver lives are their fantasy
But you're lucky cause that ain't me


Most girls think guys are all the same
Not you so I can take the blame
I love you through the joy and pain
Even the coldest Georgia rain


See my love is like a open sky
See my heart is like the river wide
No my world would never ever run dry
It runs over for you and I
See my love is deeper than the sea
And sweeter than a pretty melody
So tell everybody that you're glad you got me
You can trust in my love
My L-O-V-E
(My love, My love, My)


Some think that love is just a word
Because of all the things they've heard
They think they're gotta close their hearts
Can't see the light, the soul in the dark
But I know I got a real good man
Who loves me the best as he can
That's why I'm here faithfully
Cause you'll do the same for me


You gotta go through
The fire (the pain)
The rain (the joy)
Take the joy and do it in pain
(Never give in)
Give in
Don't give up
(Don't give up)
We can try but it will never never break my love


Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
See my love


song: Your Song
singer: Elton John
emotions: love


It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live


If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you


And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world


I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on


So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen


And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world


I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world


song: Tiny Dancer
singer: Elton John
emotions: wistful


Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand


Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad


Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows the tune she hums


But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly slowly


Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today


Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

song: Iris
band: Goo Goo Dolls
emotions: wistful, sad


And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now


And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
When sooner or later it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight


And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am


And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive


And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am


And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am


And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am


I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am


song: Slide
band: Slide
emotions: sad, love


Could you whisper in my ear
The things you wanna feel
I'd give you anythin'
To feel it comin'


Do you wake up on your own
And wonder where you are?
You live with all your faults


I wanna wake up where you are
I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide


Yeah, I'm gonna let it slide


Don't you love the life you killed?
The priest is on the phone
Your father hit the wall
Your ma disowned you


Don't supposed I'll ever know
What it means to be a man
It's somethin' I can't change
I'll live around it


I wanna wake up where you are
I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide
Ooh, slide


And I'll do anythin' you ever dreamed to be complete
Little pieces of the nothin' that fall
Oh, May
Put your arms around me
What you feel is what you are
And what you are is beautiful
Oh, May
Do you wanna get married Or run away?


And I'll do anythin' you ever dreamed to be complete
Little pieces of the nothin' that fall
Oh, May
Put your arms around me
What you feel is what you are

Or run away?

Why don't you slide into my room
Just slide into my room
Oh, we'll run away, run away, run away


song: Suspicious Minds
singer: Gareth Gates


emotions: love, sad
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?


emotions: sad
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds


emotions: sad
So, if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see these tears are real
I'm crying


emotions: love
Oh let our love survive
Or dry the tears from your eyes
Let's not let a good thing die
When honey, you know
I've never lied to you
Ooh yeah, yeah


emotions: love
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out


song: Anyone Of Us
singer: Gareth Gates
emotions: regretful


I've been letting you down, down
Girl I know I've been such a fool
Giving in to temptation
When I should've played it cool
The situation got out of hand
I hope you understand


It can happen to..
Anyone of us, anyone you think of
Anyone can fall
Anyone can hurt someone they love
Hearts will break
'Cause I made a stupid mistake
It can happen to..
Anyone of us, say you will forgive me
Anyone can fail
Say you will believe me
I can't take my heart will break
'Cause I made a stupid mistake
A stupid mistake


She was kind of exciting
A little crazy I should've known
She must have altered my senses
'Cause I offered to walk her home
The situation got out of hand
I hope you understand


A stupid mistake
she means nothing to me
(nothing to me)
I swear every word is true
don't wanna lose you


song: Follow Through
singer: Gavin Degraw
emotions: love


Oh, this is the start of something good
Don't you agree?
I haven't felt like this in so many moons
You know what I mean?
And we can build through this destruction
As we are standing on our feet
So, since you want to be with me
You'll have to follow through
With every word you say
And I, all I really want is you
You to stick around
I'll see you everyday
But you have to follow through
You have to follow through
These reeling emotions they just keep me alive
They keep me in tune
Oh, look what I'm holding here in my fire
This is for you
Am I too obvious to preach it?
You're so hypnotic on my heart
So, since you want to be with me
You'll have to follow through
With every word you say
And I, all I really want is you
You to stick around
I'll see you everyday
But you have to follow through
You have to follow through
The words you say to me are unlike anything
That's ever been said
And what you do to me is unlike anything
That's ever been
Am I too obvious to preach it?
You're so hypnotic on my heart
So, since you want to be with me
You'll have to follow through
With every word you say
And I, all I really want is you
(For) you to stick around
I'll see you everyday
But you'll have to follow through
With every word you say
An I, all I really want is you (For) you to stick around
I'll see everyday
But you have to follow through
You have to follow through
You're gonna have to follow
Oh, this is the start of something good
Don't you agree?


song: I Dont Wanna Be
singer: Gavin Degraw
emotions: angry


I don't need to be anything other
Than a prison guard's son
I don't need to be anything other
Than a specialist's son
I don't have to be anyone other
Than the birth of two souls in one
Part of where I'm going, is knowing where I'm coming from


I don't want to be
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do
Is think of me and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've got to do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't want to be anything other than me


I'm surrounded by liars everywhere I turn
I'm surrounded by imposters everywhere I turn
I'm surrounded by identity crisis everywhere I turn
Am I the only one who noticed?
I can't be the only one who's learned!


Can I have everyone's attention please?
If you're not like this and that, you're gonna have to leave
I came from the mountain
The crust of creation
My whole situation-made from clay to stone
And now I'm telling everybody


song: Save Tonight
singer: Eagle-Eye Cherry


emotions: love
Go on and close the curtains
'Cause all we need is candlelight
You and me, and a bottle of wine
To hold you tonight (oh)


emotions: sad
Well we know I'm going away
And how I wish - I wish it weren't so
So take this wine and drink with me
And let's delay our misery


emotions: wistful
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone


emotions: love
There's a log on the fire
And it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire
To take me away (ohh it's true)


emotions: sad
It ain't easy to say good-bye
Darlin' please, don't start to cry
'Cause girl you know I've got to go (oh)
And Lord I wish it wasn't so


emotions: wistful
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone

Tomorrow comes to take me away
I wish that I, that I could stay
But girl you know I've got to go (oh)
And Lord I wish wasn't so

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn

Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone

Oh that's right

Save tonight


song: When Mermaids Cry
singer: Eagle-Eye Cherry


emotions: sad
She was drowned in suicide
Faithless lover cast aside
This is how she came to be
Lorelei of the sea
Hopes destroyed, she wanted to find
Certain death peace of mind
Now you wonder who is she
Lorelei of the sea
Many tales I've been told of sailors having died
After seeing a mermaid known
As Lorelei
Faithless lover that is me
And she siren of the sea
So next time that the seagulls fly
Don't you cry sweet Lorelei


emotions: wistful
Seagulls fly
When mermaids cry
Those tears won't dry
For Lorelei


emotions: sad
The guilt is mine I was untrue
The question is what am I to do
All I know is I got to try
Try to find sweet Lorelei
Make amends for what's been done
'Cause I believe that she's the one
And I will go where seagulls fly
Try to find sweet Lorelei


emotions: sad
There she is I hear her cry
She's asking me if I will die
There ain't nothing I won't do
For you Lorelei


song: Burning Up
singer: Eagle-Eye Cherry
emotions: regretful


Would you believe me
If I said I'd never lie
Though it ain't easy
I can tell you I have tried
But I got to say
That it comes those days
That I told something untrue
Would you forgive me
If I said I'd lied to you


This is my fear
To tell you what I've done
As things come clear
I'm afraid that you'll be gone
But all I know
Is if you go
At least I've told what's true
Hope you'll forgive me
When I say I've lied to you


I'm burning up
I'm burning for you
When the truth has been spoken
There's nothing I can do
Yes I'm burning up
I'm burning for you
When the truth has been spoken
There's nothing I can do


How will you kill me
For what I'm about to tell
Please do it gently
'Cause you know I'm bound for hell
All I know is
I've lost my soul
I'm burning inside
Hope you'll forgive me
Yes I have lied
Oh yes I've lied


I'm burning up
I'm burning for you
When the truth has been spoken
There's nothing I can do
Yes I'm burning up
I'm burning for you
When the truth has been spoken
There's nothing I can do


Now you know that I've gone
And I've been untrue to you
And once it's told
Well you know there's nothing we can do
I regret that I let this get so out of hand
I pray, please stay, that you'll understand


I'm burning up
I'm burning for you
When the truth has been spoken
There's nothing I can do
Yes I'm burning up
I'm burning for you
When the truth has been spoken
There's nothing I can do


I'm burning up…


song: Are You Still Having fun
singer: Eagle-Eye Cherry
emotions: sad


You are on your own
You do as you please
Having so much fun
Gone and lost your reason
After all is said and done
Are you still having fun?
How were you to know when youve gone astray?
That happiness would go like a lost emotion
You have always gone your way
Are you happy today?


Well you know when youve been defeated
You dont care and you thank no one
Feeling low you will always need it
Are youre having fun


You dont know what is it youve done
You dont know that...


This was your mistake with the master plan
With all the drugs you take, you can hardly stand
After all is said and done
Are you still having fun?


Well, you know when youve been defeated
You dont care and you thank no one
Feeling low you will always need it
Are youre having fun...
Are you still having fun?


You dont know what it is youve done
Just to show that youre having fun


You dont know what it is youve done
Just to show that...


I can set you straight if you let me stay
I hope Im not too late
No you wont regret it
I can show you the way
And make you happy today


Yes, you know when youve been defeated
You dont care and you thank no one
Feeling low you will always need it


Well, you know when youre being cheated
Yes, you know when youve been defeated
Feeling low you will always need it
Now you*re having fun...


And are you still having fun?
Are you still having fun?
Are you still having


song: Walking On A Dream
band: Empire Of The Sun
emotions: wistful


Walking on a dream
How can I explain
Talking to myself
Will I see again


We are always running for the thrill of it thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out and out again
Never looking down I'm just in awe of what's in front of me


Is it real now
When two people become one
I can feel it
When two people become one


Thought I'd never see
The love you found in me
Now it's changing all the time
Living in a rhythm where the minutes working overtime


We are always running for the thrill of it thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out and out again
Never looking down I'm just in awe of what's in front of me


Is it real now
When two people become one
I can feel it
When two people become one


Is it real now
When two people become one
I can feel it
When two people become one


Catch me I'm falling down
Catch me I'm falling down


Don't stop just keep going on
I'm your shoulder lean upon
So come on deliver from inside
All we got is tonight that is right 'till first light


Is it real now
When two people become one
I can feel it
When two people become one


Is it real now
When two people become one
I can feel it
When two people become one


song: We Are The People
band: Empire Of The Sun
emotions: wistful


We can remember swimming in December
Heading for the city lights in 1975
We share in each other
Nearer than farther
The scent of a lemon drips from your eyes


We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try


We lived an adventure
Love in the Summer
Followed the sun till night
Reminiscing other times of life
For each every other
The feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven, got lost in your eyes


I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?


I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?


Can you remember and humanise?
It was still where we'd energised
Lie in the sand and visualise
Like it's '75 again


We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try


I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?


I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?


I know everything about you
You know everything about me
We know everything about us


I know everything about you
You know everything about me
We know everything about us


I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?


I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?


I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?


song: Blue
band: Eiffel 65
emotions: crazy, happy


Yo listen up here's a story
About a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night and everything he sees
Is just blue like him inside and outside
Blue is his house with a blue little window
And a blue corvette
And everything is blue for him and himself
And everybody around
'cause he ain't got nobody to listen to


I'm blue da ba dee da ba die...


I have a blue house with a blue window.
Blue is the colour of all that I wear.
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too.
I have a girlfriend and she is so blue.
Blue are the people here that walk around,
Blue like my corvette, it's standing outside.
Blue are the words I say and what I think.
Blue are the feelings that live inside me.


I'm blue da ba dee da ba die...

song: Carrie
band: Europe
emotions: sad


When light goes down, I see no reason
For you to cry. We've been through this before
In every time, in every season,
God knows I've tried
So please don't ask for more.


Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye


Carrie, Carrie, things they change my friend
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet again


I read your mind, with no intentions
Of being unkind, I wish I could explain
It all takes time, a whole lot of patience
If it's a crime, how come I feel no pain.


song: Rock The Night
band: Europe


emoitons: angry
I've gone through changes
I've gone through pain
But there's not enough reason for me to go insane
I know the feeling, when it grows
I'm in a rage up from my head down to my toes.


emotions: sad
You know it ain't easy
Running out of thrills
You know it ain't easy
When you don't know what you want.


emotions: party
Rock now, rock the night
'Til early in the morning light
Rock now, rock the night
You'd better believe it's right.


emotions: upbeat
I know my limit
Just what it takes
When things ain't good enough
I just pull the brake
Sometimes it's easy
Sometimes so tough
But just have one thing clear
I can't get enough.






song: Where do you go
singer: Cher
emotions: wistful


Where do you go when you're too young.
You found a world that's just begun.
Who's gonna say don't stay too long, or right from wrong, who leads you on.
Where do you go, I don't know.
Ask your Mom but right now she's mad, the night before she fought your dad.
She's help you out if she had the time, but your Dad is sad and your Mother's crying.
Where do you go, I don't know.
So you're down on your knees and you hope that helps.
You just can't think of nothin' else.
How do you pray and what do you say, let me know right away.
God show me the way, where do you go, I don't know


song: Bang Bang
singer: Cher


emotions: wistful
I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight


emotions: sad
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down


emotions: wistful
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play


emotions: sad
Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down


emotions: sad
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Now he's gone I don't know why
And 'til this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie


emotions: sad
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down


song: Song For You
singer: Cher


emotions: sad
I've been so many places in my life and time
Sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme
I got out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now I'm singing this song
Singing this song for you


emotions: sad
I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darling can you please see through me
Cause we're alone now
And I'm singing this song for you


emotions: sad
You taught me precious secrets of the truth
We're only nothing
You came out in front when I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words can come together
Listen to the melody
Cause my love is in there hiding


emotions: love
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
Singing this song, singing this song for you


song: My Love
singer: Cher
emotions: love


When I go away
I know my heart can stay with my love
It's understood
Everywhere with my love
My love does it good, whoa
My love, oh only my love
My love does it good


And when the cupboard's bare
I'll still find something there with my love
It's understood
Everywhere with my love
My love does it so good, whoa
My love, oh only my love
My love does it good


Only my love, oh only my love
Only my love, hold the other things to me
Oh, only my love, oh only my love
Only my love does it good to me


Everywhere with my love
Don't you see my love
It does it so good
Oh, only my love, only my love
My love does it good


Don't ever ask me why
I never say "good-bye" to my love
It's understood
'Cause everywhere with my love
My love does it good, whoa
Only my love, oh only my love
My love does it good
Oh only my love
Only my love does it good to me,whoa


song: What Are Words
singer: Chris Medina
emotions: love, sad


Anywhere you are, I am near
Anywhere you go, I'll be there
Anytime you whisper my name, you'll see


Where every single promise I'll keep
Cause what kind of guy would I be
If I was to leave when you need me most


What are words
If you really don't mean them
When you say them


What are words
If they're only for good times
Then they're done


When it's love
Yeah, you say them out loud
Those words, They never go away
They live on, even when we're gone


And I know an angel was sent just for me
And I know I'm meant to be where I am
And I'm gonna be


Standing right beside her tonight
And I'm gonna be by your side
I would never leave when she needs me most


What are words
If you really don't mean them
When you say them


What are words
If they're only for good times
Then they're done


When it's love
Yeah, you say them out loud
Those words, They never go away
They live on, even when we're gone


Anywhere you are, I am near
Anywhere you go, I'll be there
And I'm gonna be here forever more


Every single promise I'll keep
Cause what kind of guy would I be
If I was to leave when you need me most
I'm forever keeping my angel close


song: Amazed
singer: Chris Medina
emotions: love


I'm amazed
That the world's such a phony place
But baby when I see your face,
I'm like a kid with a balloon
Woah oh, and I'm amazed
At every star in the Milky Way,
A cold drink on a sunny day,
By the way I feel when I find myself without you.
Cause people change, but we remain...


I'm amazed,
When your smile is pourin' over me
That you achieve when it's out of reach,
Then I know you're the most beautiful, beautiful girl to me
When you laugh and you call me names,
And you play those silly games,
Then I know you're the most beautiful, beautiful girl to me.
Girl to me.


I'm amazed,
At the fact that you found much strength
You were down and got up again,
And all that you have done,
Woah oh, and I'm amazed
takes through nowadays
Lullabies in every spoken phrase,
By the way I feel when I find myself without you.
Cause people change, but we remain...


I'm amazed,
When your smile is pourin' over me
That you achieve when it's out of reach,
Then I know you're the most beautiful, beautiful girl to me
When you laugh and you call me names,
And you play those silly games,
Then I know you're the most beautiful, beautiful girl to me.
Girl to me.


Oh, always knew that we were gonna make it
That we would never ever knew defeat,
And I can feel, we're for real,
Every wound, getting healed,
It's amazing, I'm amazed


When your smile is pourin' over me
That you achieve when it's out of reach,
Then I know you're the most beautiful, beautiful girl to me.


I never wasted time with feelings,
Until I lost myself in you,
And now I'm losing it again.
I'm so shaken by the feelings,
I'm so amazed they're comin' true,
Cause now I'm losing it again.


Amazed,
When your smile is pourin' over me
That you achieve when it's out of reach,
Then I know you're the most beautiful, beautiful girl to me
When you laugh and you call me names,
And you play those silly games,
Then I know you're the most beautiful, beautiful girl to me.
Oh I'm amazed by you,
You make me smile baby,
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful girl
Amazing to me, amazing.

emotions: happy


What a girl wants, what a girl needs.
Yeah, come on.


I wanna thank you for giving me time to breathe
Like a rock you waited so patiently
While I got it together
While I figured it out, yeah yeah
I only looked but I never touched
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us
Holdin' hands, makin' plans and it's lucky for me you understand


What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me
Yeah Yeah


What I want is what you got
And what you got, is what I want.


There was a time I was blind, I was so confused
Run away just to hide it all from you.
But baby, you knew me better than I knew myself
They say if you love something let it go
If it comes back it's yours
That's how you know
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure
And you're ready and willin'
To give me more than


What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me
Yeah Yeah

Somebody sensitive, courageous,
Sexy, cool, like you.
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, oh yeah.


What a girl wants (you're so right)
What a girl needs (you're so right)
You let a girl know how much you
Care about her, I swear
You're the one who always knew...
You knew, you knew, you knew, you knew...


Ooh, I'm thanking you for being there for me.
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms,
Whatever keeps me in your arms, that's what I need...


What a girl wants

Yeah Yeah


song: Believe Me
singer: Christina Aguilera
emotions: love


I was alone just because
I wasn't like them
They made me, excluded so cruel, and
Then there was you
You stood by me, ignored their words
You became, my best friend so true, oh yeah


You believed in me
When no one else did
You gave me the strength to
Move on, my friend
You will always be
The one I remember
To give my thanks to
For my success


They just did not understand
What I was going through
My situation, they didn't care, no
You tried to take a stand for me
When I just could not
Take it any longer


You believed in me
When no one else did
You gave me the strength to
Move on, my friend
You will always be
The one I remember
To give my thanks to
For my success


I ohh, as I look back
I can see how childish they were
And you ohh, you showed me that
We were so much more than they were
I hope they can see their mistakes now
And not do it to another
But if they don't, I hope that person
Finds someone like you


Ohh...
You believed in me
When no one else did
Yeah ohh, no, ohh yeah, oh


You will always be
The one I remember
Will always be the one I remember, oh no
For my success
For my, for my success, ohh


You believed in me
When no one else did, ohh yeah
Ohh, the strength to move on, yeah
The one I remember, oh
With all my heart, yeah


song: Cant Hold Us Down
singer: Christina Aguilera
emotions: upbeat


So what am I not supposed to have an opinion
Should I be quiet just because I'm a woman
Call me a bitch cos I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled


When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Making up a few false rumors or two


That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say


This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
So what do we do girls?
Shout out loud!
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave them proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down


Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Never can, never will


So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying
Are you offended by the message I'm bringing
Call me whatever cos your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing


If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore


I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it & the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
Start a new beginning for us everybody sing


This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
What do we do girls?
Shout Out Loud!
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down


Check it - Here's something I just can't understand
If the guy have three girls then he's the man
He can either give us some head, sex a roar
If the girl do the same, then she's a whore
But the table's about to turn
I'll bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put their name on it
It's airight though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryin to mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back


But you're just a little boy
Think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big
To make up for smaller things
So you're just a little boy
All you'll do is annoy
You must talk so big
To make up for smaller things


This is for my girls...
This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
So what do we do girls?
Shout out loud!
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down


This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard
So what do we do girls?
Should out loud!
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down
Spread the word, can't hold us down

Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candyman, Candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Sweet sugar candy man


I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really had me working up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm
He's a one stop shop, makes the panties drop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candy man
A sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman


Oh yeah..


He took me to the Spider Club at Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise
the gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline


He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candy man
A sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman


Se bop bop
Hey yeah
...


He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candy man oh
A sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman


Woo yeah


Well by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth he really hit the spot
He had lips like sugar cane
Good things come to boys who wait


Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candy man, candy man
Sipping from a bottle of vodka double wine
Candy man, candy man


Sweet sugar candy man
He's a one stop, gotcha hot, making all the panties drop
Sweet sugar candy man
He's a one stop, got me hot, making my uh pop
Sweet sugar candy man
He's a one stop, get it while it's hot, baby don't stop
Sweet sugar


He got those lips like sugar cane
Good things come for boys who wait


He's a one stop shop with a real big uh
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman

Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Jane lost her grip and a-down she fell
Squared herself away as she let out a yell

Smile, an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost it's glory
Lets start a brand new story
Now my love
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say...
It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away


Talk, in everlasting words
And dedicate them all, to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me

"I'm sorry,"
It's all that you can say?
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like "sorry" (like "sorry"...like "sorry"...)

song: Born To Make You Happy
singer: Britney Spears
emotions: sad, love


I'm sitting here alone up in my room
I'm thinking about the times that we've been through
Oh, my love
I'm looking at a picture in my hand
Trying my best to understand
I really want to know what we did wrong
With a love that felt so strong
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right


I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy


I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
I'd better give it up and carry on
Oh, my love
'Cause living in a dream of you and me
Is not the way my life should be
I don't want to cry a tear for you
So forgive me if I do (ooh)
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right


I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy


(Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
I'd do anything
I'd give you my world
I'd wait forever to be your girl
(Just call out my name)
Just call out my name (and I will be there) and I will be there (ooh)
Just to show you how much I care (alright) (ooh)
I was born to make you happy, yeah (ooh) (oh yeah)


I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
(Oh, oh)
I was born to make you happy
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy 


song: Lucky
singer: Britney Spears


emotions: happy
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go…
"Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say…


emotions: sad
She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night


emotions: wistful
Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me what happens when it stops?
They go…
"Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say…


emotions: happy
"Best actress, and the winner is…Lucky!"
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky"
"Oh my god…here she comes!"


emotions: sad
Isn't she lucky, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there's nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?

And I love what you do
Don’t you know that you’re toxic

It’s in the air
And it’s all around
Can you feel me now

And I love what you do
Don’t you know that you’re toxic
Don't you know that you're toxic

You're toxic I'm slipping under

Don't you know that you're toxic

emotions: crazy
Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up
Shut it up, just shut up
Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up
Shut it up, just shut up


emotions: love, upbeat
We try to take it slow
But we're still losing control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm craaazzzy
For trying to be your laaadddy
I think I'm going crazy


emotions: love, upbeat
Girl, me and you were just fine (you know)
We wine and dine
Did them things that couples do when in love (you know)
Walks on the beach and stuff (you know)
Things that lovers say and do
I love you boo, I love you too
I miss you a lot, I miss you even more
That's why I flew you out
When we was on tour
But then something got out of hand
You start yelling when I'm with my friends
Even though I had legitimate reasons (bull shit)
You know I have to make them dividends (bull shit)
How could you trust our private lives girl
That's why you don't believe my lies
And quick to say


emotions: love, upbeat
Why does emotion gotta move so fast
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on taking it slow
So why does it got to be so damn tough
'cause fools in lust could never get enough of love
Showing him the love that you be giving
Changing up your living
For a loving transition
Girl its a mission trying to get you to listen
Few mad at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street saying
“Who the hell?!?”
Who the hell?
What the hell's going down?
Too much of the bickering
Kill it with the sound and


emotions: love, upbeat
Girl our love is dying
Why did you stop trying
I never been a quitah
But I do deserve betta
Believe me I will do bad
Let's forget the past
And let's start this new plan
Why? 'cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl I know you're tired of the things they say
You're damn right
'cause I heard them lame dame excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing
Same ass excuses
Boy you're useless
Woooaaahhh!!!
Stop the talking baby
Or I start walking baby
Is that all there is


song: Dont Lie
band: Black Eyed Peas


emotions: regretful
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
Hey, baby my nose is getting big
I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's getting weaker
Probably coz my lies just started getting deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I have been a little immature
Fucking with your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies I was the editor
And the author
I forged my signature
And now I apologise for what I did to you
Cos what you did to me I did to you


emotions: crazy
No,no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie
No, no, no, no, yeah, you know, know, know, know, you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I really see you & what you're all about
No, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie
Yeah, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you gotta try


emotions: regretful, sad
She said I'm leaving
Cos she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed too many games
She feeling like a fool getting on the last train
Trying to maintain but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things


emotions: regretful
And I lie and I lie and I lie and I lie
And now our emotions are drained
Cos I lie and I lie and a little lie lie
And now your emotions are drained


emotions: crazy
No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie (no, don't you lie)
No, no, no, no, yeah, you know, know, know, know, you gotta try (got to try, got to try)
What you gonna do when it all comes out (what you gonna do baby)
When I really see you & what you're all about
Nonono babe, no, no, no, no don't lie
Because you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, gotta try
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ba da ba da ba da ba da badabada


emotions: love, regretful
Yo, I'm lying to my girl
Even though I love her
And she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds & pearls
She's the one who makes me feel on top of the world
Still I lie to my girl, I do it


And I lie and I lie and I lie till there's no turning back
I don't know why, (and I lie and I lie till I don't know who I am)


song: Straight from the heart
singer: Bryan Adams
emotions: wistful, love


I could start dreamin' but it never ends
As long as you're gone we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin'
Straight from the heart


You say it's easy but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier
Straight from the heart


Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go
As long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart


I'll see you on the street some other time
And all our words would just fall out of line
I was dreamin'
Straight from the heart


Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go
As long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart


Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go
As long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart

Oh - thinkin' about all our younger years
There was only you and me

Oh - once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down

It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

For somethin' to arrive
For love to come along


Now our dreams are comin' true
Through the good times and the bad
Yeah - I'll be standin' there by you


And baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe

singer: Katy Perry


emotions: sad
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything


emotions: upbeat
You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready cause I’ve had enough
I see it all, I see it now


emotions: upbeat
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero


emotions: upbeat
You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready ’cause I’ve had enough
I see it all, I see it now

song: Wrecking Ball
singer: Miley Cyrus


emotions: wistful
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny


emotions: wistful
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you


emotions: sad
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me


emotions: sad
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you’re not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we’re ashes on the ground


emotions: wistful
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you


emotions: sad
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me


emotions: sad, wistful
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should’ve let you win
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should’ve let you win
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you


emotions: sad
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me

Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me


song: Story Of My Life
band: One Direction


emotions: sad
Written in these walls all the stories that I cant explain,
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days,
She told me in the morning she don’t feel the same about us in her bones,
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone,
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight with nothing in between


emotions: wistful
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm and time-
Is frozen
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she’s broke inside
The story of my life


emotions: sad
Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning I'll see us in the light upon the pier
Although I'm broken my heart is untamed still
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holding on so tight
With nothing in between


emotions: wistful
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm and time-
Is frozen
The Story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she’s broke inside
The story of my life
And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But baby running after you is like chasing chasing the clouds


emotions: wistful
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm and time
Is frozen
The Story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she’s broke inside
The story of my life
The story of my life
The story of my life
The story of my life


song: Wake Me Up
singer: Avicii
emotions: wistful


Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me


So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost


I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize


So wake﻿ me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost


I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost


song: Let Her Go
band: Passenger


emotions: wistful
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go


emotions: wistful
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you’re missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go


emotions: sad, wistful
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast


emotions: wistful
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast


emotions: wistful
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much
And you dived too deep

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go


emotions: wistful
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only hate the road when you're missin' home

song: Demons
band: Imagine Dragons


emotions: wistful
When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold


emotions: sad, wistful
When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale


emotions: sad, wistful
I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide


emotions: sad, wistful
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come


emotions: sad
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide


emotions: wistful
Curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl


emotions: wistful
So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you've made


emotions: sad
Don't wanna let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don't wanna hide the truth


emotions: sad, wistful
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come


emotions: sad
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide


emotions: wistful
They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go


emotions: wistful
Your eyes, they shine so bright
I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how


emotions: sad
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide


song: I See Fire
singer: Ed Sheeran


emotions: wistful
Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brother's souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin sons


emotions: wistful, sad
If this is due end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high
Into the night
Calling out father, oh,
Stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn over and on the mountain side, high


emotions: sad
And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine
For the last time
Calling out father, oh,
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn over and on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky


emotions: wistful
Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And i see fi-i-ire
Hollow and slow
And I see fi-i-i-ire
Blood in the breeze
And i hope that you remember me


emotions: sad, wistful
Oh should my people fold and
Surely I'll do the same
Come find in mountain holes we
Got too close to the flame
Calling out father, oh,
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames watch the flames burn over and on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky


emotions: wistful, sad
Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And i see fi-i-ire
Hollow and slow
And I see fi-i-i-ire
Blood in the breeze
And i hope that you remember me


emotions: sad, wistful
And if the night is burning i will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky is falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow on the ground I hear my people screaming out


emotions: wistful, sad
And I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And i see fi-i-ire
Hollow and slow
And I see fi-i-i-ire
Blood in the breeze
And I see fire
(oh you know I saw a city burning)
Fire
And I see fire
(feel the heat upon my skin)
Fire
And I see fire
(oooh)
And I see fire burning over and on the mountain side.


song: Bad Day
singer: Justin Bieber
emotions: sad


No I didn’t think you would let me down that easy (oh no, girl)
And I didn’t think it was over
Until you walked away
Like it was nothing, baby


And that moment was so hard for me to breathe
‘Cause you took away the biggest part of me, yeah
Life is so unpredictable


Never thought a love like yours could leave me all alone (oh no)
Didn’t waste any time
Like you had already made up your mind
No sympathy
‘Cause I was out of line (oh, yeah)


But I didn’t think you would let me down that easy (oh no, girl)
And I didn’t think it was over
Until you walked away
Like it was nothing, girl


It was a bad day (hey, yeah, yeah)
I know I was wrong
But you could have said “goodbye” baby
It was a bad day
Now I’m like, “wow”


It was a bad day
It was a bad day
It was a bad day

I hide it well, hope you can’t tell but I hope she smells my perfume


song: Still Into You
band: Paramore


emotions: love
Can't count the years on one hand
that we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better


It's not a walk in the park
to love each other
But when our fingers interlock,
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it
'Cause after all this time, I'm still into you


I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)


Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah after all this time I'm still into you


Recount the night that
I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya


You felt the weight of the world
fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
we sang along to the start of forever
And after all this time, I'm still into you


I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah after all this time I'm still into you


Some things just, some things just make sense
and one of those is you and I (Hey)
Some things just, some things just make sense
and even after all this time (Hey)


I'm into you, baby not a day goes by
that I'm not into you


I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far


'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah after all this time
I'm still into you
I'm still into you
I'm still into you


song: Marry Me
singer: Jason Derulo


emotions: love
105 is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That’s precisely what I plan to do


And you know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life
Will forever be enough, so there ain’t no need to rush
But one day, I won’t be able to ask you loud enough


I’ll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I’ll say will you marry me


How many girls in the world can make me feel like this?
Baby I don’t ever plan to find out
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why
You’re the love of my life


You know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life
We'll forever be in love, so there ain’t no need to rush
But one day, I won’t be able to ask you loud enough


I’ll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I’ll say will you marry me


And if I lost everything
In my heart it means nothing
‘Cause I have you, girl I have you
So get right down on bended knee
Nothing else would ever be
Better, better
The day when I say


I’ll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I’ll say will you marry me


I’ll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I’ll say will you marry me


105 is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That’s precisely what I plan to do…


song: Wasting All These Tears
singer: Cassadee Pope


emotions: sad, wistful
I tried to find you at the bottom of a bottle
Laying down on the bathroom floor
My loneliness was a rattle in the windows
You said you don't want me anymore


emotions: sad, regretful
And you left me
Standing on a corner crying,
Feeling like a fool for trying
I don't even remember
Why I'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Oh, finally I'm through
Wasting all these tears on you
These tears on you
emotions: sad
You ain't worth another sleepless night
And I'll do everything I gotta do to get you off my mind
Cause what you wanted I couldn't get
What you did, boy I'll never forget


emotions: sad, regretful
And you left me
Standing on a corner crying
Feeling like a fool for trying
I don't even remember
Why I'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Oh, finally I'm through
Wasting all these tears on you
These tears on you


emotions: sad, regretful
And you left me
Standing on a corner crying
Feeling like a fool for trying
I don't even remember
Why I'm wasting all these tears on you
I wish I could erase our memory
Cause you didn't give a damn about me
Oh, finally I'm through
Wasting all these tears on you
These tears on you

emotions: upbeat, party
Yea I’m a new man baby
Yo other man probably should follow my bank plan baby
Strap on yo seat and get ready to go
You know we feelin', be 43 million feet up in the sky full of diamonds
I’m only beginning then I get the feeling that we had yo people to light this
I got a few Miami vices
I don’t never look at the prices
My super bow flickers are priceless
You know who the king
And the night is beautiful
Music for you to go low
I’m feeling a bit awkward, this moment I think I’m bout home


emotions: happy
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
It’s a new day,
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky

You know how I feel


emotions: party
What a feeling I get when I throw up my pistol, somebody is bigger than life
50 bottles of lumen, it’s Dom Perignon, bout my dollars, we good for the night
Cameras flickin', I see me and vixen
I’m fixin my call on my natural high
She can get it, my whole clique is with it
No question, we over, it’s everything bout it
This ho'w I ride, my passenger fly
We took off in London and land in Dubai
This is America, music my ride
My life is so lavish, you don’t recognize
So let’s toast to a new day and vouch yea
80 million and still rolling, hold still
Both of us agree to this compulsion
I got this melody so we’re like vultures


emotions: party
Who told y'all the party’s over
Well it ain’t over til I told ya
I fill my cup, running over
Tomorrow I might be sober
But tonight I’m like

Birds flying high
It’s a new day
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
It’s a new day,
You know how I feel

song: Bring Me To Life
band: Evanescence


emotions: sad
How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core where I’ve become so numb
Without a soul my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home


emotions: sad, regretful
(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside
(I can’t wake up)
Wake me up inside
(Save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run
(I can’t wake up)
Before I come undone
(Save me)
Save me from the nothing I’ve become

Now that I know what I’m without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life

Save me from the nothing I’ve become


emotions: regretful
Bring me to life
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)
Bring me to life


emotions: sad, love
Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead


emotions: sad, regretful
All this time I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
I’ve been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life


emotions: sad, regretful
(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside
(I can’t wake up)
Wake me up inside
(Save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark

Bid my blood to run
(I can’t wake up)
Before I come undone
(Save me)
Save me from the nothing I’ve become

(Bring me to life)
I’ve been living a lie, there’s nothing inside
(Bring me to life)


song: We Found Love
singer: Rihanna


emotions: love, sad
It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed
That someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless; like nothing can save you
And when it's over, and it's gone
You almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good


emotions: upbeat
Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we’re standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It’s the way I’m feeling I just can’t deny
But I’ve gotta let it go


emotions: love, upbeat
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


emotions: love, upbeat
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
It’s the way I’m feeling I just can’t deny
But I’ve gotta let it go


emotions: love, upbeat
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


emotions: upbeat
Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we’re standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine (mine, mine, mine)

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Hot summer streets
And the pavements are burning
I sit around
Trying to smile
But the air is so heavy and dry


emotions: wistful
Strange voices are saying
What did they say
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort
This heat has got right out of hand


emotions: sad, love
It's a cruel, cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, cruel summer
Now you're gone


emotions: sad
The city is crowded
My friends are away
And I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle
So I got to get up and go

It's a cruel, cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel,

Leaving me here on my own

Now you're gone
You're not the only one

Leaving me
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel,
It's a cruel cruel summer
Now you're gone
You're not the only one

On the phone

Then we can
Build our lives
Then we can
Be as one

From the moment I met you I just knew you'd be mine
You touched my hand
And I knew that this was gonna be our time
I don't ever wanna lose this feeling
I don't wanna spend a moment apart

That's why I'm by your side, and that's why I love you

And I've just got to be near you every day and every night
And you know that we belong together
It just had to be you and me

All those pretty memories,
I know you can hear me now
For the record,
I love you, I love you


When I found out that you were leaving me,
I couldn't sleep thinking about
All the things that we've been through
Now all that I want to do
Is tell you that I, (I)
Miss you...so much...
(You know I really really miss you...)


Now that I'm on my own
I know that in time I'll find somebody new
(Who'll treat me better than you)
So I'll go all alone without you
But I still love you
You know I'll never live without you


I wish you'd change your ways soon enough
So we can be together
You just don't understand good enough
But now all we have is memories...


Memories we shared
No one else could compare
Ohh, I miss you, I miss you
Oh I miss you


...of the way we used to be,
Oh, those pretty memories


Oh.......
I miss you...
I miss you...
Oh, I miss you...
Ohh…

So glad that I got you, I got you


song: One
singer: Mary J Blige
emotions: love


Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now?
You got someone to blame


You say one love, one life (one life)
It's one need in the night
One love (one love), get to share it
Leaves you darling, if you don't care for it


Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without


Well it's too late, tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One...


Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus?
To the lepers in your head


Well, did I ask too much, more than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well we, hurt each other
Then we do it again


You say
Love is a temple
Love is a higher law
Love is a temple
Love is the higher law
You ask me to enter
Well then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on
To what you got
When all you got is hurt


One love
One blood
One life
You got to do what you should
One life
With each other
Sisters and my
Brothers
One life
But we're not the same
We get to
Carry each other
Carry each other


One...
One love

song: No Woman No Cry
band: Boney M
emotions: wistful


No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
Cause I remember when we used to sit
In a government yard in trenchtown
Observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have, now
Good friends we have lost
Along the way
In this great future,
You can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say


No woman no cry
No woman no cry
Oh little darling, don't shed no tears
No woman no cry
Cause I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in trenchtown
When Georgie would make the fire lights
I say, log would burnin' through the nights
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on thru,
And while I'm gone

song: Rasputin
band: Boney M
emotions: crazy, love


There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the bible like a preacher
Full of ecstacy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire


RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on


He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son


RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on


But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger
for power became known to more and more people,
the demands to do something about this outrageous
man became louder and louder.


"This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged "Don't you try to do it, please"
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
"Come to visit us" they kept demanding
And he really came


RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"


RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead


song: You Give Love A Bad Name
band: Bon Jovi
emotions: love, angry


An angel's smile is what you sell
You promise me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free


You're a loaded gun
There's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done


Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love a bad name


Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye


You're a loaded gun
There's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done


song: Livin On A Prayer
band: Bon Jovi
emotions: love, upbeat


Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck...it's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man, she brings home her pay
For love - for love


She says we've got to hold on to what we've got
'Cause it doesn't make a difference
If we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love - we'll give it a shot


Whooah, we're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
Livin' on a prayer


Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used
To make it talk - so tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers baby it's okay, someday


We've got to hold on to what we've got
'Cause it doesn't make a difference
If we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love - we'll give it a shot


We've got to hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got


song: Bed Of Roses
band: Bon Jovi


emotions: regretful
Sitting here wasted and wounded
At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka
Is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead


emotions: wistful, love
With an ironclad fist I wake up and
French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
Its own beat in my head
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and
What you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need


emotions: wistful, love
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses


emotions: wistful, love
Well I'm so far away
That each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
Just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper,
Baby blind love is true


emotions: wistful, love
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses


emotions: sad
The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died


emotions: wistful, love
Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight I won't be alone
But you know that don't
Mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend


emotions: wistful, love
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses


song: Wherever you will go
band: The Calling


emotions: love, wistful
So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face


emotions: love, sad
If a great wave shall fall
It'd fall upon us all
And between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?


emotions: love, sad
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go


emotions: wistful
And maybe, I'll find out
The way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days


emotions: love, sad
If a great wave shall fall
It'd fall upon us all
Well I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you


emotions: sad
Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love


emotions: love, sad
I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time


emotions: love
If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go
I'll go wherever you will go


song: For You
band: The Calling
emotions: love


I am a vision
I am justice
Never thought that I could love
Living in shadows
Fading existance
It was never good enough
Within the darkness
You are the light that shines the way
But you're trapped in violence
I can be the man who saves the day


I'm there for you
No matter what
I'm there for you
Never giving up
I'm there for you
For You


Someone's changed me
Something's saved me
And this is who I am
Although I was blinded
My heart let me find out
That truth makes a better man
I didn't notice
That you were right in front of me
Our masks of silence
We'll put away so we can see


I'm there for you
No matter what
I'm there for you
Never giving up
I'm there for you
For You


Within the darkness
You are the light that shines a way
In this blind justice
I can be that man who saves the day


I'm there for you
No matter what
I'm there for you
Never giving up
Cause you know it's true
You were there for me
And I'm there for you
For you
For you
For you

I feel so close to you right now

I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love


emotions: wistful, upbeat
I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason
You're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again


emotions: love, upbeat
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love


emotions: wistful, upbeat
Now I'm dreaming, will I ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this but I know I'm not that strong
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again


emotions: love, upbeat
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love


emotions: wistful, upbeat
All the years
All the times
You have never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing
And all the tears
All the lies
All the waste
I've been trying to make a change
And now my eyes are open


emotions: love, upbeat
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free


song: Well Be Coming Back
singer: Calvin Harris


emotions: wistful
We took it all apart but I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room something I heard you say
We didn't wanna call it too early
Now it seems a world away but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?


emotions: upbeat
Standing in the light till it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day


emotions: wistful
You can see it from afar, we were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?


emotions: upbeat
Standing in the light till it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day


emotions: wistful, upbeat
Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts


emotions: upbeat
Standing in the light till it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day


song: Sweet Nothing
singer: Calvin Harris


emotions: wistful, upbeat
You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst,
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now


emotions: angry, upbeat
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing


emotions: angry
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing


emotions: wistful, upbeat
It isn't easy for me to let it go
Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now


emotions: angry, upbeat
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing


emotions: angry, upbeat
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing


emotions: angry
And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing


emotions: crazy, upbeat
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Nothing
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Sweet nothing
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Sweet nothing


song: Inside Your Heaven
singer: Carrie Underwood
emotions: wistful, love


I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around
I guess its right, it's so amazing
Everytime I see you I'm alive
You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes


I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven


When we touch, when we love
The stars light up
The wrong becomes undone
Naturally, my soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes


And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows you away
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in
A soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven


When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holdin you until the day I die
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows you away


I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows you away
I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
Oh yes I do
I wanna be inside your heaven


song: Good In Goodbye
singer: Carrie Underwood
emotions: sad


I heard you laughing in a crowd outside a restaurant we used to go to
I caught a glimpse that stopped me in my tracks
It took me back
You looked happy with that little girl up on your shoulders, happy
I know where she got those crystal eyes of blue
Time’s been sweet to you


As bad as it was, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn’t get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you’re holding on to someone that you gotta let go
Someday you’ll see the reason why
Sometimes, yeah, sometimes, there’s good in goodbye


I don’t regret it
The time we had together
I won’t forget it
But we both ended up where we belong
I guess goodbye made us strong
And yeah I’m happy
I found somebody too who makes me happy
And I knew one day I’ll see you on the street
And it’d be bittersweet


But as bad as it was, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn’t get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you’re holding on to someone that you gotta let go
Someday you’ll see the reason why
Yeah, sometimes, yeah sometimes, there’s good in goodbye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


As bad as it was, yeah, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn’t get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you’re holding on to someone that you got to let go
Someday you’ll see the reason why
Yeah, someday you’ll see the reason why
There’s good in goodbye, yeah
Yeah


song: Yellow
band: Coldplay
emotions: wistful, love


Look at the stars,
Look how they shine for you,
And everything you do,
Yeah, they were all yellow.


I came along,
I wrote a song for you,
And all the things you do,
And it was called "Yellow".


So then I took my turn,
Oh what the things have done,
And it was all yellow.


Your skin,
Oh yeah your skin and bones,
Turn into
Something beautiful,
You know,
You know I love you so,
You know I love you so.


I swam across,
I jumped across for you,
Oh what a thing to do.
'Cause you were all yellow,


I drew a line,
I drew a line for you,
Oh what a thing to do,
And it was all yellow.


Your skin,
Oh yeah your skin and bones,
Turn into
Something beautiful,
And you know,
For you I'd bleed myself dry,
For you I'd bleed myself dry.


It's true,
Look how they shine for you,
Look how they shine for you,
Look how they shine for,
Look how they shine for you,
Look how they shine for you,
Look how they shine.


Look at the stars,
Look how they shine for you,
And all the things that you do.


song: The Scientist
band: Coldplay
emotions: wistful


Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I'll set you apart


Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming in tails
Heads on a science apart


Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start.


I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart


Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are


Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start
